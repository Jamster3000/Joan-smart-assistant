# Joan

ü§ñ This is a smart assistant called "Joan". Being developed purposly for running on low resource systems, such as a raspberry pi. It uses machine learning (scikit-learn) rather than chatbot frameworks (such as tensorflow, chatterbot, etc.), which is much faster and allows for more control over how the assistant works. In addition to this, A.I. isn't used for this because it's easier to understand and know what's going on with machine learning than it is A.I. frameworks.

In addition to the machine leaning it also uses several different APIs and more to come. None of these used API's have been paied for as they are free or use a free tier. A list of API's that are used:
- Wolfram  Alpha - Used to respond to anything that "Joan" can't or doesn't have a response for. Joan saves the answer allowing it to do "Live Learning".
- Accuweather - Used to get weather data from a location (The user doesn't need to give "Joan" their location, It just knows).
- omdbapi - (Open Movie Database) API for getting data about movies, although Wolfram Alpha also knows information about movies.
- spaceflightnewsapi - Gets news about space flights and events in relation to it.
- currentsapi - Gets general news which also contains keywords to each article allowing the user to filter news sources.
- genderize - This is used to determine what gener the user is, this seems to work pretty well.
- totalvirus - this is used to scan a website, whether that be the website that is open or a link that was last copied.
- api64.ipify - Get's the user's IP address.
- ipapi - This is used to get the user's IP data, which includes their current location.

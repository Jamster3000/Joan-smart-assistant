"Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian. The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that patrolled the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian, I'm bored and frustrated at being a prawn, I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten...As Justin had his mind firmly on becoming a predator, a mysterious cod appears and says, Your wish is granted, and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.Time went on and Justin found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While out swimming alone one day he sees the mysterious cod again and can't believe his luck. Justin figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn. He begs the cod to change him back so, lo and behold,he is turned back into a prawn.With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef, he searched for his old pal. Where's Christian? he asked.He's at home, distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark, came the reply.Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's house. As he opened the coral gate the memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again. Christian replied No way man, you'll eat me. You're a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked. Justin cried back No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.I've found Cod. I'm a prawn again, Christian!",

He bent open the bars, and beat the guy senseless.When the guy finally came to his senses, he reported the incident to the zookeeper.

Of course he knew that gorillas were natural mimics so he proceeded to put on one of the party hats. As expected, the gorilla looked at him, reached through the bars, grabbed a hat from the bag, and put it on. Next, the guy picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla reached out, picked up the other horn, and did the same. Finally, the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage out of his pants, and sliced it in half.

"There was once this guy who was on a quest to cross the Sahara desert solo, we will call him Simon, for that is a good name for a camel rider. Well he started out and things were going along just fine for weeks, however gradually he noticed a change in his camel, slowly but surely it seemed to be traveling slower and slower. It had been a while since he had drunk water but camels were supposed to be able to survive for long periods without water he thought to himself. Well eventually the poor ol' camel just stopped altogether. Great! thought Simon, now I'm really in trouble. After some time trying to pull the camel, push the camel and do anything he could to get the camel moving, he was resigned to the fact that he wasn't going anywhere fast.Suddenly, almost out of nowhere this guy comes driving up to him in a small truck with a sign on the side Camel Starters R US. Well Simon couldn't believe his luck. This is unbelievable! he says as the truck approaches. The driver leans out the window and says Got some camel trouble there buddy? The reply was swift, Sure have, can you help?. Sure I can, says the driver and before you know it he has the camel up on the back of the truck and he says to Simon Hop in.After a bit of a drive they arrive at what appears to be the Camel Starters R US workshop. The driver loads the camel onto the mechanics 'pit' and proceeds down underneath to look at the underside of the camel. Yep, I can see what the problem is there I'll have your camel started in no time matey.  Sometimes they just get a bit disoriented and lose their way, but we know the trick to get 'em going again, don't you worry. Fantastic Simon replies. The driver then grabs a couple of bricks extends his arms out horizontally and brings them together in a mighty thump right on the camels balls. VRRRROOOOOOOMMMMMMMM... the camel is gone in a plume of dust. Incredible, look at him go! says Simon But I just have one problem, the camel is definitely started, but how the heck am I going to catch him? The driver responds, Hop up on that stand for me son.",

Way up in heaven, Saint Peter sees all this and asks God, ''Are you really going to let him get away with this?'' ''No, I guess not,'' says God.

To this God says, ''Who's he going to tell?''",

"The first 90% of a project takes 10% of the time, the last 10% takes the other 90% of the time.If at first you don't succeed, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it.The more crap you put up with, the more crap you are going to get.Keep your boss's boss off your boss's back.If you can't get your work done in the first 24 hours, work nights.A pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the butt.Don't be irreplaceable, if you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.It doesn't matter what you do, it only matters what you say you've done and what you're going to do.After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the month than you did before.You can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a clipboard.Eat one live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.When the bosses talk about improving productivity, they are never talking about themselves.There will always be beer cans rolling on the floor of your car when the boss asks for a ride home from the office.Everything can be filed under Miscellaneous.Never delay the ending of a meeting or the beginning of a cocktail hour.To err is human, to forgive is not our policy.Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he/she is supposed to be doing.Important letters that contain no errors will develop errors in the mail.If you are good, you will be assigned all the work. If you are really good, you will get out of it.You are always doing something marginal when the boss drops by your desk.People who go to conferences are the ones who shouldn't.If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done.At work, the authority of a person is inversely proportional to the number of pens that person is carrying.When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried.Following the rules will not get the job done.Getting the job done is no excuse for not following the rules.When confronted by a difficult problem you can solve it more easily by reducing it to the question, How would the Lone Ranger handle this?No matter how much you do, you never do enough.The last person that quit or was fired will be held responsible for everything that goes wrong.",
"A guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom.  He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. What's up? he asks.

Uncle Ted's  hiding in your wardrobe and he's got no clothes on! The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there is his  brother, totally naked, cowering on the wardrobe floor. ''You bastard, says the husband. My wife is having a heart attack and you're running around with no clothes on scaring the kids!",

The Whistle sounded, again he pulled, no movement. God! If you get my foot out I will stop smoking. The whistle sounded closer. Still pulling, he only seemed to get more stuck.  God! If you get my foot out I will stop smoking and drinking. Looking up he could now see the train engineer in the window of the engine.  His foot still would not move.  God!!! If you get my foot out I will stop, smoking drinking and give my money to the poor!At that moment his foot slipped from its grasp in the rail and he rolled clear of the train's wheels.............

"A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman's face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter. After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, ''Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.'' ''My darling,'' he replied, ''think nothing of it.

Still sobbing, the bride said, Mother, words like dust, wash, iron, cook.",
"My friend, said St. Peter to the recently deceased, you did lead an exemplary life on earth - but there is one instance of your taking the name of The Lord in vain. Would you care to tell us about it? I recall, replied the new applicant, it was in 1965 on the last hole at Pinehurst. I only needed a par four to break 70 for the first time in my life. Was your drive good? asked St. Peter, with increasing interest. Right down the middle. But when I got to my ball, it was plugged deep in a wet rut made by a drunk's golf cart. Oh dear, said St. Peter, A real sucker! Is that when you... No. I'm pretty good with a 3-iron. I played the ball close to my feet, caught the sweet spot and moved it right onto the green. But it bounced on a twig or something - it was a very windy day - and slid off the apron right under the steepest lip of the trap. What a pity! said St. Peter consolingly, Then that must have been when... No. I gritted my teeth, dug in with and open stance, swung a smooth outside arc, and backspun a bucket's worth of sand up onto the green. When everything settled down, there was my ball, only ten inches off into the cup. JESUS CHRIST! shrieked St. Peter, don't tell me you choked the putt!",

We'll make him a Cardinal, he can play Shimon Peres....we can't lose! Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made and, of course, Jack was honoured and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of his success in the match. I came in second, your Holiness, said Nicklaus. Second!? exclaimed the surprised Pope. You came in second to Shimon Peres!!?? No, said Nicklaus, second to Rabbi Palmer.",

"A country club didn't allow women on the golf course. Eventually, there was enough pressure that they decided to allow women on the course during the week. The ladies were satisfied with this arrangement, formed a women's club, and became active. After about 6 months, the club board received a letter from the women's club complaining about the men urinating on the golf course. Naturally, they just ignored the matter. After another 6 months, they received another letter reminding them of the previous letter and demanding action. After due deliberation they sent the women a letter advising them that they had been granted equal privileges!",
"Four guys who worked together always golfed as a group at 7 a.m. Sunday. But one of them got transferred, and they were talking about trying to fill out the foursome. A woman standing near the tee said, Hey, I like to golf, can I join the group? They were hesitant but said she could come once to try it. She said Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or quarter to seven. She showed up right at 6:30, and wound up setting a course record with a 7-under-par round. The guys went nuts and everyone in the clubhouse congratulated her. Meanwhile, she was fun and pleasant the entire round. The guys happily invited her back the next week and she said Sure, I'll be here at 6:30 or quarter to 7. Again, she showed up at 6:30 Sunday morning. Only this time, she played left-handed, and matched her 7-under par score of the previous week. By now the guys were totally amazed, and they asked her to join the group for keeps. They had a beer after their round, and one of the guys asked her, how do you know if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed? She said That's easy. Before I leave for the golf course, I pull the covers off my husband, who sleeps in the nude. If his member is pointing to the right, I golf right-handed; if it's pointed to the left, I golf left-handed. A guy asked what if it's pointed straight up? She said Then I'll be here at nine o'clock.",
"A man went to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. When he arrived at his Motel, he found he had a lot of time before the meeting so he got the directions for a nearby golf course from the clerk. While playing on the front nine, he thought over his impending speech and became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained the situation and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. She replied, I'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole. He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened and he approached her again with the same request. She said, I'm on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th. Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. He approached her and said, Let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your help. I understand you are in the sales profession. I'm in sales also. What do you sell?She replied, If I told you, you would only laugh. No I wouldn't. Well if you must know, she answered, I sell sanitary towels. She said, See I knew you would laugh. That's not what I'm laughing at he replied, I'm a toilet paper salesman, so I'm still a hole behind you!",

"Bill and Ralph, both of equal ability, decide to have a round together and play it as it lays on all shots. Both hit their tee shots on the par-5 first hole down the middle and about 260 yards. They drive up for the second shot, and Bill hits his shot down the middle for an easy approach, but Ralph slices his over the trees and it ends up in the cart path of the adjoining hole. Guess I get a free drop from the cart path, he says. Oh no, says Bill, We agreed. Play it as it lays. So Ralph drives Bill up to his ball in front of the green, drops him off and drives over to his ball on the cart path. Bill watches in amusement as sparks shower down from the practice swings of his opponent, then, in amazement as a perfectly struck shot lands on the green and rolls to within 3 ft. of the pin. Ralph drives back to the green. Bill says, Great shot back there! What club did you use? Ralph responds, Your six iron.",
"Four men, well along in years, had played golf as a foursome every Sunday morning, until one of them passed away. The other three asked the club pro if he could find them a compatible gentleman to fill out the foursome again. No problem, answered the pro. But, you have to understand, one of the guys, named George, explained, that Moe, who died, was like our eyes. We're all getting some cataracts, and have trouble seeing the ball. Moe's eyesight was perfect, and he was our spotter. The pro promised to see what he could do, and, when the others returned the following Sunday, he introduced them to a truly ancient looking gentleman, named Gary. How old are you? George asked. I'm ninety-four, Gary responded. Fabulous, said George. But how's your eyesight? At this, Gary blew up. Don't insult my eyes, he yelled. I may be old, but I've got 20-20 vision. I have eyes like an eagle. Don't insult me! Okay, okay, the others said. Let's play golf. George was first on the tee, and he hit a long, low drive, that faded significantly after about 200 yards. He turned to Gary. Did you see where it went? he asked the ancient one. Did I see where it went? I told you not to insult my eyesight. Of course, I saw where it went. I've got eyes like an eagle! Gary yelled. Okay, I'm sorry, said George. Where did it go? Gary dropped his head, and muttered, I forgot.",
"A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home.Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone.Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him.To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time.Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree. With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man offered one more comment, Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.",
"Dick brings a friend to play golf with two of his buddies to complete a foursome. His buddies ask him if his friend can play golf. Dick says that he is very good. This guy hits the ball on the first hole in the bush, so his buddies look at him and say, You said your friend was a good golfer. Dick says Yes, he is watch him play. They see the ball come out of the bush on the green. This guy takes two putts to make par. Second hole is par 3. This guy hits the ball into the lake. The two buddies looks at Dick again and say You said this guy was good Dick replies that this guy was a great player. So the guy walks into the the lake. Three minutes later they can't see the guy.

Sid says to Barney, Let's say we make the time worth the while, at least for one of us, and spot $5 on the lowest score for the day. Barney agrees and they enjoy a great game. After the 8th hole, Barney is ahead by 1 stroke, but cuts his ball into the rough on the 9th.Help me find my ball; you look over there, he says to Sid. After 5 minutes, neither has had any luck, and since a lost ball carries a four-point penalty, Barney pulls a ball from his pocket and tosses it to the ground. I've found my ball! he announces triumphantly.Sid looks at him forlornly, After all the years we've been friends, you'd cheat me on golf for a measly five bucks?What do you mean, cheat? I found my ball sitting right here!And a liar, too! Sid says with amazement. I'll have you know I've been standing on your ball for the last five minutes!",
"The worst  member of Augusta approached Ben Crenshaw after the Master's Tournament. He challenged him to a match - double or nothing the prize money he had just one. Crenshaw was hesitant but, hey, who doesn't need more money, right? To make it fair he offered the guy any handicap he wanted. The member requested two gottcha's. Crenshaw wasn't sure what a gottcha was but since the man was insistent, he agreed. They went out to the first tee and the member took a swing at his ball and sliced mightily. Crenshaw got up and teed up his ball. The guy came up behind Crenshaw and swung his driver hard between Crenshaw's legs. GOTTCHA! he screamed. Crenshaw squirmed in agony, fell to the floor clutching his groin with tears streaming down his face. That's one gottcha gone said his challenger. Crenshaw took quite some minutes to compose himself again and played on. At the end of the round the people couldn't believe that Crenshaw had lost. His only comment, Ever play a round of golf waiting for the second gottcha?",

"I. Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower.  II. Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket. III. Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish.  IV. Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. V. Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off.  IV. Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait.  After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. But at least now he smells a lot better.",

"A young couple was invited to a swanky masked Halloween Costume party. The wife came down with a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party and have a good time. Being the devoted husband, he protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed. She told him there was no need for him to miss the fun. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early she decided to go to the party. Because hubby did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some kicks watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not around. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor. He was dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a feel here and taking a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new action. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little bang. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped out, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of excuse he would have for his notorious behavior. She was sitting up reading when he came in, and she asked him what he had done. He said, Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there. Then she asked, Did you dance much? He replied, I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got to the party I met Pete, Bill and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you . . . the guy that I loaned my costume to sure had one hell of a time!",

But on that fateful autumn afternoon, it was to be different. Trouser's owners were walking him along a trail at the park, when suddenly from out of the bushes jumped a man all dressed in black. He had white paint on his face, and was gesturing annoyingly at Trouser's masters. This strange person spoke not a word, but proceeded to pretend that he was trapped in a box and that he was pulling on a long rope. Seeing the sheer horror on his masters' faces, Trouser took it upon himself to rectify the situation. With a low growl he jumped and sank his teeth into this annoying pseudo clown's leg. Trouser immediately got a sickened look in his eyes and began to vomit wildly. He then dragged his tongue all over the ground in an effort to remove the man's foul essence from his mouth. For Trouser had learned that .... a mime is a terrible thing to taste.",

"It was the final examination for an introductory Biology course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out new students, having over 500 students in the class! The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail. Half of an hour into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet. You're not going to have time to finish this, the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet. Yes, I will, replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in. All except the late student, who continued writing. An hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there.No, you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late. The student looked incredulous and angry. Do you know who I am? No, as a matter of fact I don't, replied the professor with an air of sarcasm in his voice. Do you know who I am? the student asked again in a louder voice. No, and I don't care, replied the professor with an air of superiority.

"Simon the humble Crab and Kate the Lobster Princess were madly, deeply and passionately in love. For months they enjoyed an idyllic relationship until one day Kate scuttled over to Simon in tears.  We can't see each other any more... she sobbed.  Why? gasped Simon. Daddy says that crabs are too common, she wailed. He claims you are a mere crab, and a poor one at that, and crabs are the lowest class of crustacean and that no daughter of his will marry someone who can only walk sideways.  Simon was shattered, and scuttled sidewards away into the darkness to drink himself into a filthy state of aquatic oblivion.  That night, the great Lobster ball was taking place. Lobsters came from far and wide, dancing and merry making, but the lobster Princess refused to join in, choosing instead to sit by her father's side, inconsolable.  Suddenly the doors burst open, and Simon the crab strode in.  The lobsters all stopped their dancing, the Princess gasped and the King Lobster rose from his throne.  Slowly, Simon the crab made his way across the floor, and all could see that he was walking, not sideways, but FORWARDS; yes FORWARDS, one claw after another! Step by step he made his approach towards the throne, until he looked the King Lobster in the eye.  There was a deadly hush for quite a while.  Finally, the crab spoke - Bugger, I'm pissed.",

The grave digger replied No problem, I have ways for you to save money while having your husband buried. How? The woman asked. It's very simple, the grave digger replied.

To save money on space of the burial, bury your husband standing up instead of laying down. To save money on the headstone, all you need to do to identify your husband is to bury only half of his body and leave his head and half of his body above groud. This also saves money and labour of me digging a whole grave!",

I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans. Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. He said, 'Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?'",

I was just hired this morning by the lady of the house. Well, this is her husband. Is she there? Ummm .... she's upstairs in the bedroom with someone who I just figured was her husband. The guy is fuming. He says to the maid, Listen, would you like to make $50,000? What do I have to do? I want you to get my gun from my desk in the den and shoot that witch and the jerk she is with. The maid puts down the phone. The guy hears footsteps, followed by two gunshots. The maid comes back to the phone. What should I do with the bodies? Throw them in the swimming pool! What?!

"Dear Mother and Dad,    It has been three months now since I left for college.  I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not writing before.  I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down.  You are not to read further unless you are sitting down, okay?     Well, then, I'm getting along pretty well now.  The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well  healed.  I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day.     Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance.  He also visited me in the hospital and since I have nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment.    It's really a basement room, and it's kind of cute.  He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy  begins to show.  I know how much you are looking forward to being   grandparents, and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the  same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.    The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection that prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.  I have bumps all over my down there but this will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.  I know that you will welcome him into our family with open arms.  He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious.  Although he is of a different race, color and religion than ours, I know your often-expressed tolerance will not  permit you to be bothered by this fact.     Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire.  I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture.  I was not in the hospital.  I am not pregnant.  I am not   engaged.  I do not have a disease and there is no miscegenation in my life.  However, I am getting a D in history and an F in science,   and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.    Your loving daughter, JL",

Just as the gorilla finished, the lion awoke and was really pissed. The lion started chasing the gorilla through the zoo and was beginning to gain on him.

From behind the paper, the gorilla said, You mean the one that screwed the lion? The lion shook his head and shouted, Oh No! It's already in the papers!",
"A farmer was worried that none of his pigs were getting pregnant. He called a vet and asked what he should do if he wanted more pigs. The vet told him he should try artificial insemination. The farmer, not wanting to appear stupid, answered okay and hung up the phone. Unclear on what the vet meant by artificial insemination, the farmer decided it must mean he had to impregnate the pigs himself, so he loaded all the pigs in his pickup, drove down to the woods, and shagged them all. The next day he called the vet again, and asked how he would know if the pigs were pregnant. The vet told him they would be lying down rolling in the mud, but when he looked not even one was lying down.

"Adam and Eve said, Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us every day. Now we do not see you any more. We are lonesome here, and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us.   And God said, No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourselves.   And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve.  And it was a good animal.  And God was pleased.   And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his tail. And Adam said, Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.   And God said, No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.     And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and loved them.   And they were comforted.   And God was pleased.  And Dog was content and wagged his tail. After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said, Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught them that they are loved, but perhaps too well.   And God said, No problem! I will create for them a companion who will be with them forever and who will see them as they are. The companion will remind them of their limitations, so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration.  And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve. And Cat would not obey them. And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat's eyes, they were reminded that they were not the supreme beings. And Adam and Eve learned humility. And they were greatly improved.And God was pleased.  And Dog was happy. And Cat didn't give a shit one way or the other.",

I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment. Conversation wasn't flowing so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk, he agreed but he kept quiet and absent. I asked him what was wrong - he said, Nothing. I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said it had nothing to do with me and not to worry. On the way home I told him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior; I don't know why he didn't say, I love you, too. When we got home I felt as if I had lost him, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there and watched TV.; he seemed distant and absent. Finally I decided to go to bed.

Hey there kid, if you get in my car, I'll give you all this candy, and a big bottle of cola. How about it? No way! Now leave me alone! The boy walks on, quickening his pace. The car again pulls over beside him. Look, kid, I've got a puppy at home you'd love to see. Get in and I'll take you there. You can have all the candy and the cola on the way. What d'you say to that? The boy is getting agitated. He stops walking, and leans down to the car window. Look, I don't care what you promise me Dad. I'm NOT riding in your Lada!",

"A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large, beautiful  parrot. There was a sign on the cage that read $50. Why so little? she asked the pet store owner. The owner looked at her and said, Look, I should tell you first ... that this bird used to live in a house of  prostitution, and sometimes he says some pretty vulgar stuff. The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She  took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room, and waited for it to say something. The bird carefully looked around the room, then it looked at her and said, New house ... new madam. The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought, That's not so bad. When her two teenage daughters returned from school the parrot looked at both of them, and said, New house ... new madam ... new hookers. The girls were at first a bit offended, but then began to laugh about the whole situation. She then began to think about how to explain this to  Keith, her husband. Moments later, the woman's husband came home from  work. Before he had time to close the door, the bird took one look at him and said, Hi Keith.",

"The local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around that they offered a standing $1000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many people had tried over time  but nobody could do it.One day, this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice, I'd like to try the bet. After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away, then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man.But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass. As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man, What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, or what? The man replied, I work for the IRS.",

The next morning he was greeted with a cup of coffee that was full to the brim, and the next morning and the morning after that.The judge couldn't resist gloating over his success and smugly complimented the clerk on his new technique.

"The widow takes a look at her dear departed one right before the funeral and, to her horror, finds that he's in his brown suit. She'd specifically said to the undertaker that she wanted him buried in his blue suit; she'd brought it especially for that occasion, and she was distressed that the mortician had left him in the same brown suit he'd been wearing when the lightning bolt hit him.She demanded that the corpse be changed into the blue suit she'd brought especially for that purpose. The undertaker said, But madam! It's only a minute or two until the funeral is scheduled to begin! We can't possibly take him out and get him changed in that amount of time.The lady said, Who's paying for this? Seeing the logic to this argument, a very reluctant mortician wheeled the coffin out, but then wheeled it right back in a moment later. Miraculously, the corpse was in a blue suit.After the ceremony, a well-satisfied widow complimented the undertaker on the smooth and speedy service. She especially wanted to know how he'd been able to get her husband into a blue suit so fast. The funeral director said, Oh, it was easy. It happens that there was another body in the back room and he was already dressed in a blue suit. All we had to do was switch heads!",

"Once upon a time... There lived a king. The King had a beautiful daughter, the Princess. But the kingdom was a sad place. There was no laughter, and no joy. The problem was, that everything the Princess touched would melt. No matter what, metal, wood... anthing she touched would melt!! Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. The king despaired. What could he do to help his beautiful daughter? He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured. The King was overjoyed. The next day, he held a competition. Any man who could bring his daughter an object that would not melt at her touch, would marry her and inherit the King's wealth. Three young princes took up the challenge. The first Prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. When the Princess touched it, it melted. The Prince went away sadly. The second Prince brought a huge diamond, thinking that diamond is the hardest substance in the world and will not melt. But, alas, once the Princess touched it, it melted.

"A school teacher injured his back and had to wear a plaster cast around the upper part of his body. It fitted under his shirt and was not noticeable at all. On the first day of the term, still with the cast under his shirt, he found himself assigned to the toughest students in school.Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, he opened the window as wide as possible and then busied himself with desk work. The classroom became a bit unruly and he admonished them. This happened several times.When he could do work at his desk, the strong breeze from the window made his tie flap annoyingly. He kept rearranging and rearranging the tie as the class raised its level of unruliness.Finally, becoming disgusted with the wayward tie, he stood up and took a big stapler off his desk and stapled the tie to his chest in several places.Discipline was not a problem from that day forth.",

I left work at about five o clock and I went to the gas station before I picked up my brother.

So, of course, the first thing that brother of mine does when he gets in the car, is lights up a cigarette. Remember the gas I spilled on my jacket?

He rings it again.....Still no answer. So, he thinks, ''This is a big house, big party, maybe the party is outside, in the backyard.'' So he walks around the house to the back, there was no one out there either. As he approached the back door, he was suprised to find it unlocked, and opened. There was obviously no one home, so he figured he'd just quietly run inside real quick, and use there bathroom, no one would know. So, he goes inside but he can't find the bathroom anywhere. So, he quickly ran up the stairs and searched, and searched, till finally as he opened a door to a small room, he was amazed to find a GOLDEN TOILET. He had never seen anything like it, but remembering that he was in a stranger's house, and that they could at anytime return home, he quickly did his business and walked out. As he got in the car he excitedly told his friends of the AMAZING GOLDEN TOILET. They laughed in disbelief at his crazy tale. They pulled out of the driveway, arguing about it. They argued the whole way to the party. A couple of hours later, on the way home from the party. They drive past the house with the GOLDEN TOILET. And they guy insists on stopping so he could prove to his friends the these people really did have a GOLDEN TOILET. So, they agree to check it out. So they all walk up to the front door and ring the door bell. And a woman answers the door. ''Excuse me maam, but could you please let me show my friends here your GOLDEN TOILET, they don't believe me!'' ''So YOU'RE the guy!'' The woman replies, then yells to her husband in the house, ''HONEY!?!...HERE'S THE GUY THAT POOPED IN YOUR TUBA!'''",
"A small boy and his father were visiting a nearby mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny silver walls that moved apart and back together again by themselves. The lad asked, What is this, father? The father  responded, I have no idea what it is. While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a wheelchair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched as small circles lit up above the walls. The walls opened up again and a beautiful twenty-four-year-old woman stepped out. The father looked at his son anxiously and said, Go get your mother.",
"A devoted wife had spent her lifetime taking care of her husband. Now he had been slipping in and out of a coma for several months, yet she stayed by his bedside every single day. When he came to his senses, he motioned for her to come near him. As she sat by him, he said, ''You know what? You have been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you were by my side. When we lost the house, you gave me support. When my health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?'' ''What, my dear?'' she asked gently. ''I think you bring me bad luck.''",

"Humphrey comes up to the Mexican border on his bicycle. He's got two large bags over his shoulders. The guard stops him and says, What's in the bags? Sand, answered Humphrey. The guard says, Well, we'll see about that.  Get off the bike. The guard takes the bags and rips them apart; he empties them out and finds nothing in them but sand. He detains Humphrey overnight and has the sand analyzed, only to discover that there is nothing but pure sand in the bags. The guard releases Humphrey, puts the sand into new bags, hefts them onto the man's shoulders, and lets him cross the border. A week later, the same thing happens. The guard asks, What have you got? Sand, says Humphrey. The guard does his thorough examination and discovers that the bags contain nothing but sand.  He gives the sand back to Humphrey, and watches him cross the border on his bicycle. This sequence of events repeated everyday for three years. Finally, Humphrey doesn't show up one day and the guard meets him in a Cantina in Mexico. Hey, Buddy, says the guard, I know you're smuggling something. It's driving me crazy.

"After many years of marriage, a husband turned into a couch potato, became completely inattentive to his wife and sat guzzling beer and watching TV all day. The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of its mouth.The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a special imported Goony bird and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate, he exclaimed, Goony bird! The table!Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, Goony bird! The shelf!Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.Wow! said the wife, If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing will! So she bought the bird and took it home.When she entered the house, the husband was, as usual, sprawled on the sofa guzzling beer and watching the game. Honey! she exclaimed, I've got a surprise for you! A Goony bird!The husband, in his usual bored tone replied, Goony Bird, my foot!",

"On their way to a justice of the peace to get married, a couple had a fatal car accident. The couple found themselves sitting outside Heaven's Gate waiting on St.Peter to do an intake. While waiting, they wondered if they could possibly get married in Heaven. St. Peter finally showed up and they asked him. St. Peter said, I don't know, this is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out. and he left. The couple sat and waited for an answer...for a couple of months...and they began to wonder if they really should get married in Heaven, what with the eternal aspect of it all. What if it doesn't work? they wondered, Are we stuck together forever? St. Peter returned after yet another month, looking some what bedraggled. Yes, he informed the couple, you can get married in Heaven. Great,said the couple, but what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven? St. Peter, red-faced, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. What's wrong?, asked the frightened couple. COME ON! St. Peter shouted, It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it will take me to find a lawyer?",

After several minutes, St. Peter closes the book, furrows his brow, and says, I'm sorry, I don't see your name written in the Book. How current is your copy? he asks. I get a download every ten minutes, St. Peter replies, why do you ask? I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I was always the stubborn type. It was not until my death was immanent that I cried out to God, so my name probably hasn't arrived to your copy yet. I'm glad to hear that, Pete says, but while we're waiting for the update to come through, can you tell me about a really good deed that you did in your life? The guys thinks for a moment and says, Humm, well there was this one time when I was drivin' down a road and I saw a giant group of biker gang members harassing this poor girl. I slowed down, and sure enough, there they were, about 20 of 'em torturing this poor woman. Infuriated, I got out my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and walked up to the leader of the gang. He was a huge guy; 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ears. As I walked up to the leader, the bikers formed a circle around me and told me to get lost or I'd be next. So I ripped the leader's chain out of his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron. Then I turned around and yelled to the rest of them, Leave this poor innocent girl alone! You're all a bunch of SICK, deranged animals! Go home before I really teach you a lesson in PAIN! St. Peter, duly impressed, says Wow! When did this happen? About three minutes ago.",

Insist that the trick-or-treaters each do ten push-ups before you give them any candy. Hand out menus to the trick-or-treaters and let them order their candy. Keep asking if anyone wants to see the wine list. Get a catapult. Sit on your porch and catapult pumpkins at anyone who comes within 50 yards of your house. When people come to the door, jump out a nearby window, crashing through the glass, and run as far away from your house as you can. Answer the door dressed as a pilgrim. Stare at the trick-or-treaters for a moment, pretend to be confused, and start flipping through a calendar. Instead of candy, give away colored eggs. If anyone protests, explain that the eggs are the only thing you had left over from Easter. Answer the door dressed as a dentist. Angrily give the trick-or-treaters a two-hour lecture on tooth decay. Answer the door with a mouthful of M  M's and several half-eaten candy bars in your hands. Act surprised, and close the door. Open it again in a few seconds, and insist that you don't have any candy. Hand out cigarettes and bottles of asprin. Put a crown on a pumpkin and put the pumpkin on a throne on your porch. Insist that all of the trick-or-treaters bow before the pumpkin. Dress up like a bunny rabbit. Yell and curse from the moment you open the door, and angrily throw the candy at the trick-or-treaters. Slam the door when you're finished.",

He couldn't hang onto the branch forever, and there was no way for him to climb up the steep wall of the cliff. So Jack began yelling for help, hoping that someone passing by would hear him and lower a rope or something. HELP! HELP! Is anyone up there? HELP! He yelled for a long time, but no one heard him. He was about to give up when he heard a voice. Jack, Jack, can you hear me? Yes, yes! I can hear you. I'm down here! I can see you, Jack. Are you all right? Yes, but who are you, and where are you? I am the Lord, Jack. I'm everywhere. The Lord? You mean, GOD? That's Me. God, please help me! I promise if you'll get me down from here, I'll stop sinning. I'll be a really good person.

"This Is From A Florida Newspaper...A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the house in the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the crash,ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the floor,cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him and the patio door shattered. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill,the wife went down several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some paper towels, blotted up the gasoline and threw the towels in the toilet. The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom,sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen,heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance. The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them on the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street.

He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely.He has had more experience, but it's the first time his finger has found the right place. He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him-- he's done this many times before.

He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake you head and nod for him to go on.

"Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had two extra things left in his bag of creations. So, he decided to split them between Adam and Eve. He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the ability to stand up while urinating. It's a very handy thing, God told the couple, who he found under an apple tree. I was wondering if either one of you wanted the ability. Adam jumped up and blurted, Oh, give that to me! I'd love to! Please, oh please, oh please, let me have that ability. It'd be so great! When I'm out working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just stand there and let it fly! It'd be so cool, I could write my name in the sand. Oh, please God, let it be me who you give that gift to, let me stand and pee, oh please!! On and on he went, like an excited little boy who...well...had to pee. Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted that so badly, that he should have it. it seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him happy, and she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given this ability. And so, Adam was given the ability to control the direction of his micturition while in a vertical position. He was so happy, he celebrated by wetting down the bark on the tree nearest him, laughing with delight all the while. And it was good.Fine, God said, looking back into his bag of leftover gifts, What's left in here? Oh yes, he said, Multiple orgasms...",

"This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. known as:Millennia Year Application Software System .Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS.We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS.Last week my secretary said to me, I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before. I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS.There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS.This database will encompass all information associated with the business. As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, Here, stick this in MYASS.",

"Two weeks ago was my forty-fifth birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning anyway. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say,Happy Birthday, and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say Good Morning, let alone any, Happy Birthday. I thought, Well, that's wives for you. Maybe the children will remember. The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. When I started to the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet, said, Good morning boss, Happy Birthday, and I felt a little better; someone had remembered. I worked until noon, when Janet knocked on my door and said, You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me.I said, By George, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go. We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go; we went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, You know, it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we? I said, No, I guess not.She said, Let's go to my apartment. After arriving at her apartment she said, Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. Sure, I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. All were singing Happy Birthday and there on the couch I sat, naked.",

Finally, the boy runs back to his house, very hungry. His mother gives him a plate with nothing on it but an apple. Disappointed, the boy says, Where's my eggs, my milk and my sausage? Well, says his mother, I saw you kick a chicken, so now you don't get eggs. I saw you kick the cow, so now you don't get milk. I saw you kick the pig, so now you don't get any sausage. Just then, the boy's father walks in and kicks the cat. The boy says to his mother, Should I tell him now, or do you want to?",
"A new arrival in Hell was brought before the devil. The devil told his demon to put the man to work on a rock pile with a 20 pound sledge hammer in 95 degree heat with 95% humidity. At the end of the day, the devil went to see how the man was doing, only to find him smiling and singing as he pounded rocks. The man explained that the heat and hard labor were very similar to those on his beloved farm back in Pennsylvania. The devil told his demon to turn up the heat to 120 degrees, with 100% humidity. At the end of the next day, the devil again checked on the new man, and found him still happy to be sweating and straining. The man explained that it felt like the old days, when he had to clean out his silo in the middle of August on his beloved farm back in Pennsylvania. At that, the devil told his demon to lower the temperature to -20 degrees with a 40 mph wind. At the end of the next day, the devil was confident that he would find the man miserable. But, instead the man was singing louder than ever, twirling the sledge hammer like a baton.When the devil asked him why he was so happy, the man answered, Cold day in hell - the Eagles must have won the Super Bowl!",

"Steve was in a terrible accident at work; however, the only permanent damage done to him was that both of his ears were amputated. Because he was permanently disfigured, he settled with the company for a rather large sum of money and went on his way.One day, Steve decided to invest his money in a small, but growing computer business, and, after weeks of negotiations, he bought the company outright. But after signing on the dotted line, he realized that he knew nothing about running such a business and quickly set out to hire someone who could do that for him. The next day he had set up three interviews.The first guy was great. He knew everything he needed to and was very interesting, but at the end of the interview, Steve asked him, Do you notice anything different about me? The gentleman answered, Why, yes, I couldn't help but notice you have no ears. Steve got very angry and threw him out.The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. He asked her the same question, Do you notice anything different about me? She replied, Well... you have no ears. Steve again was upset and tossed her out. The third and last interview was the best of all three. It was with a very young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart, he was handsome, and he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Steve was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question, Do you notice anything different about me? To his surprise, the young man answered, Yes. You wear contact lenses. Steve was shocked, and said, What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?The young man replied, Well, it's pretty hard to wear glasses with no ears!",

"FINEThis is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use fine to describe how a woman looks - this will cause you to have one of those arguments.FIVE MINUTESThis is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.NOTHINGThis means something, and you should be on your toes. Nothing is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. Nothing usually signifies an argument that will last Five Minutes and end with FineGO AHEAD This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over Nothing and will end with the word FineGO AHEAD This means I give up or do what you want because I don't care You will get a Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead in just a few minutes, followed by Nothing and Fine and she will talk to you in about Five Minutes when she cools off.LOUD SIGHThis is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A Loud Sigh means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over NothingSOFT SIGHAgain, not a word, but a non-verbal statement. Soft Sighs mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content.THAT'S OKAYThis is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. That's Okay means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. That's Okay is often used with the word Fine and in conjunction with a Raised Eyebrow.GO AHEAD!At some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.PLEASE DOThis is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a That's Okay.THANKSA woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.THANKS A LOTThis is much different from Thanks. A woman will say, Thanks A Lot when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the Loud Sigh. Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the Loud Sigh, as she will only tell you Nothing.Send this to the men you know to warn them about future arguments they can avoid if they remember the terminology!",

"Dear Sir,I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put poor planning as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.Securing the rope to the ground I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks.You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs.Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. I slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience pain.At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building.In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body. Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains the two broken legs. I hope this answers your inquiry.",

"Two elderly ladies had been friends for many decades. Over the years they had shared all kinds of activities and adventures. Lately, their activities had been limited to meeting a few times a week to play cards. One day they were playing cards when one looked at the other and said, Now don't get mad at me.....I know we've been friends for a long time, but I just can't think of your name! I've thought and thought, but I can't remember it. Please tell me what your name is. Her friend glared at her. For at least three minutes she just stared and glared at her. Finally she said, How soon do you need to know?",

"Things some people learn as they mature.I've learned that you cannot make  someone love you.  All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just jerks.I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion - not proof - to destroy it.I've learned that, without a good mind, you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big weenie or huge boobs.I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others -they are more screwed up than you think.I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities. I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there hadbetter be a lot of money to take its place.I've learned that sometimes the people you  expect to kick you when you're down, will.I've learned that we don't have to ditch bad friends, because their dysfunction makes us feel better about  ourselves.I've learned that no matter how you try to protect your children, they will eventually get arrested and end up in the local paper.I've learned to say F--- 'em if they can't take a joke in 6 languages!",
"My friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and elegant, especially in her language. She and her husband were planning a week's vacation in Florida, so she wrote to a particular campground and asked for a reservation. She wanted to make sure the campground was properly equipped, but didn't quite know how to ask about the toilet facitilities. She just couldn't bring herself to write the word toilet in her letter. After much deliberation, she finally came up the the old-fashioned term bathroom commode. But after she wrote that down, she still thought she was being too forward. So, she started all over again and re-wrote the entire letter. This time, she referred to the bathroom commode as merely B.C. Does the campground have its own B.C.? she wrote.The campground owner wasn't old-fashioned, and he just couldn't figure out what the woman was talking about. The business about B.C. stumped him. After much thought and deliberation, he showed the letter to other campers to get their opinions, but they didn't know either. The campground owner finally decided that the woman was asking about the location of the Baptist Church, and sat down and wrote this reply:Dear Madam:I regret the delay in answering your letter, but I now take great pleasure in informing you that a B.C. is located nine miles north of the campground, and is capable of seating 250 people at one time. I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of people take their lunches along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay late.The last time my wife and I went was 6 years ago, and it was so crowded we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may interest you to know that right now, there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats. They're going to hold it in the basement of the B.C. I would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly, but it surely is through no lack of desire on my end. As we grow older, it seems to take more of an effort, particularly in cold weather. If you decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go with you the first time you go, sit with you, and introduce you to all the other folks.Remember, this is a very friendly community.Best Regards, The Campgound Owner",

"There's a man named Ralph that goes into a bar, looking very depressed. A friend approaches him and asks, Why the long face, Ralph? Oh, I'm just bored. I know every person in the entire world now, and there's just nothing left to challenge me. His friend says, No, you can't know everyone. Do you know Paul McCartney? He says, Sure, Paul's an old friend of mine. Here, I'll show you. He goes over to a phone, dials a number. His friend overhears a British accent, Hey Ralph, how ya doing? He talks for a while, but when Ralph hangs up, his friend is not really sure that it was Paul McCartney on the other end of the line, so he asks him if he knows the president. Ralph says, Sure, we go way back. This time he lets him listen in as he calls a private number. It sounds like the president on the other end of the line, and they go into a big discussion of the current economic scene, and Ralph offers a few suggestions. Drawing the conversation to a close, Ralph wishes him well and hangs up. His friend is a little dumbfounded at this point. Well, there must be someone that you don't know. He goes over a few more people in his mind, and thinks, 'He can't possibly know the Pope. After all, he's a Protestant.' But Ralph claims to know him, so to convince himself otherwise, his friend decides to fly both himself and Ralph to the Vatican to get positive proof of Ralph's conviction. So they arrive at the Vatican, and Ralph suggests that his friend wait out in the Papal square until Ralph has cleared things with the Pope. He's standing in the courtyard, when who walks out onto the balcony of the private residence, arm in arm with the Pope, but Ralph. Ralph looks down, sees that his friend has apparently passed out, and runs down to see what can be done for him. What happened to you? Couldn't you accept the fact that I really do know the Pope? No, I'd begun to accept that possibility. But what really took my breath away was some stranger standing next to me who said, 'Who's that guy standing there with Ralph?'",

"Bread Is Dangerous1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users.2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread consuming households score below average on standardized tests.3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread.5. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat, begged for bread after as little as two days.6. Bread is often a gateway food item, leading the user to harder items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cream cheese.7. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey , bread-pudding person.8. Newborn babies can choke on bread.9. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 450 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than two minutes.10.

They will be extremely sociable, hardworking, and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world - as diplomats, and carriers of peace ....Michael gasped in wonder and admiration, but then proclaimed, What about balance, God?

The bartender knew of his habit, and would always have the drink waiting at precisely 5:03 p.m. One afternoon, as the end of the work day approached, the bartender was dismayed to find that he was out of hazelnut extract.

It was very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, and she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked him, and he said No.I kept thinking, Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I didn't have any clothes with me. Then I said, Matt, are you sure you did not have an accident? No, he replied. I just knew that he must have had, cause the smell was getting worse.

The doctor then asked the 5-year-old what he thought of the baby. Hit him again, the 5-year-old said. He shouldn't have crawled up there in the first place!",
"A recently divorced woman is walking along the beach contemplating how badly screwed she got over the divorce settlement, when she spies a magic lamp washing up onshore. She rubs the lamp, and out pops a magical genie!! The genie notices her anger and lets her vent her troubles to him. As a consolation, the genie informs that he will give her three wishes. But, he cautions her that because he does not believe in divorce, he will give her ex-husband ten times the amount of whatever she wishes. The woman is steaming mad, thinking that this is hardly fair, but she makes her first wish. The first wish was for a billion dollars. The genie grants her wish and she finds herself sitting in pile of one billion one-dollar bills. The genie then reminds her that her husband is now the recipient of 10 billion dollars. The woman can barely contain her anger when she makes her second wish. The second wish was for a beautiful mansion on the shore of her own private beach. In an instant it was granted, but the genie then reminds again that her ex-husband now owns ten of what she wished for, and points out the beach to a small development of ten such mansions. Upon hearing this, the woman takes her time to contemplate her last wish.  Just as the genie was about to give up on her, the woman informs the genie that she wants to make the last wish. But, before she can do this, the genie again warns her that her ex-husband will get ten times what she wishes for.  No problem, said the woman as she grinned in ecstasy. For my last wish...  I'd like to give birth to twins.",

"Two little boys were looking for a way to cool off on a hot summer day.Their dad wouldn't let them play in the sprinkler because he was mowing the lawn, so the boys set out to find a way to get wet and cool without getting into trouble.They sat on the curb brainstorming the solution, when suddenly one of them jumped up and declared, I know! Let's get baptized!Well, both boys had seen enough to know that you can get wet at a baptism, so they trotted on down to the church on the corner and told the pastor they wanted to get baptized.  The irritated pastor finally relented after about 10 minutes of begging, and he finally dragged the boys to the men's room and dunked them both head first into the toilet, then sent them on their way.The boys sat on the curb, slightly disappointed with the whole adventure, when one of them asked the other, Hey, what religion are we now?  I don't know, replied the other.

"A woman was having a terrible time sleeping. Her large dog, which slept in the bedroom with her and her husband, snored like a buzz saw. She contacted the Vet who told her of an old remedy that was handed down to him by an old Southern lady. He said when the dog began to snore, tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles.Hoping for a good night sleep, she looked into her sewing kit and found a short piece of red ribbon and placed it on the night stand. When the dog began to snore she got up and delicately tied the red ribbon around the dog's testicles. The dog immediately stopped snoring and stayed asleep. Amazing she thought, and quickly went back to sleep.Later that evening, her husband came home from a night out with the boys, stumbled into the bedroom and after undressing, flopped into bed. He immediately began to snore loudly, waking his wife. She reasoned that if it worked for the dog, maybe it would work for her husband. She got up and went to her sewing kit where she found a length of blue ribbon. Quietly and softly she tied the ribbon around her husbands testicles and he immediately quit snoring. She was amazed again and promptly returned to sleep.The next morning the husband awoke with a terrible hangover and as he stepped into the bathroom to relieve himself saw the blue ribbon around his testicles. As he walked into the bedroom, he saw the red ribbon around the dog's testicles. Through his haze, he muttered off-handedly to the dog, I don't know what we did last night, but at least we finished first and second.",

"I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck causing him to have to drive on to the shoulder to avoid hitting her. This evidently angered the driver enough that he hung his arm out his window and flipped the woman off. Man, that guy is stupid! I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why:I drive 48 miles each way every day to work, that's 96 miles each day. Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway so if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 32 miles is not bumper to bumper, I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. Statistically, half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000.In any given group of females 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That's 642. According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding. That's 449. According to the National Institute of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide. That's 98. And 34% describe men as their biggest problem. That's 33. According to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing. That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period, and is armed. Flip one off? .....I think not.",

"I suggest you sit down and relax before reading this. Your sides will be aching before you finish.Garden Snakes are DANGEROUS! Author Unknown Green garden grass snakes can be dangerous. Yes, grass snakes, not rattlesnakes.A couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants and when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa. She let out a very loud scream.The husband, who was taking a shower, ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was.She told him there was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold nosed him on the rear. He thought the snake had bitten him and he fainted.His wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. The attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying him out.About that time the snake came out from under the sofa and one of the Emergency Medical Technicians saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man.He volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushion where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the neighbor man, seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive her.The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband on the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.An ambulance was again called when it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake. She went to the kitchen, brought back a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.By now the police had arrived. They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake.The ambulance arrived and took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife. Just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch. One of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa. The table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.The other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog, who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire.Meanwhile, the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house was blazing. Neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving fire truck had started raising his ladder when they were halfway down the street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and pulled out the electricity and disconnected telephones in a ten-square city block area.Time passed...Both men were discharged from the hospital. The house was re-built. The police acquired a new car, and all was right with the world.About a year later the original couple were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. The husband asked his wife if she thought they should bring in their plants for the night.She shot him...",

"A rich lady from California, who was a tree hugger and a vociferous anti-hunter, purchased a piece of timberland in Oregon. There was a large tree on one of the highest points in the tract. She wanted to get a good view of her land so she started to climb the big tree. As she neared the top, she encountered a spotted owl that attacked her. In her haste to escape, the lady slid down the tree to the ground and got many splinters in her private parts.In considerable pain, she hurried to the nearest country doctor. Being a hunter himself, the doctor listened to her story with great patience and then told her to go into the examining room and he would see if he could help her. She sat and waited for three hours before the doctor reappeared. The angry lady demanded, What took you so long?

"This is not meant to be crude. It is strictly for your edification and enjoyment. Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating victory over the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of all captured English soldiers. Without their middle finger, it would be impossible to draw the renowned English longbow and therefore they would be incapable of fighting in the future. The longbow was a famous weapon. It was made of the native English Yew tree, and the act of drawing the longbow was known as plucking the yew. Much to the bewilderment of the French, the English won a major upset and began mocking the French by waving their middle fingers at the defeated French, saying, See, we can still pluck yew! PLUCK YEW! Over the years, some 'folk etymologies' have grown up around this symbolic gesture. Since 'pluck yew' is rather difficult to say , the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative 'F', and thus the words often used in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter. It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is known as giving the bird. Are you not thrilled that you have someone out there that will send you educational stuff like this? History repeats itself - Once again the appropriate message was given to the French!",

Its roots go back to a concept pioneered by Moe of the Three Stooges, who discovered that a patient could be made to forget about the pain in his foot if he was poked hard enough in the eyes.Q. I just joined an HMO. How difficult will it be to choose the doctor I want?A . Just slightly more difficult than choosing your parents. Your insurer will provide you with a book listing all the doctors in the plan. These doctors basically fall into two categories - those who are no longer accepting new patients, and those who will see you but are no longer participating in the plan! But don't worry; the remaining doctor who is still in the plan and accepting new patients has an office just a half-day's drive away and has a diploma from a Third World Country.Q. Do all diagnostic procedures require pre-certification? A. No. Only those you need.Q. Can I get coverage for my pre-existing conditions?A. Certainly, as long as they don't require any treatment.Q. What happens if I want to try alternative forms of medicine?A. You'll need to find alternative forms of payment.Q. My pharmacy plan only covers generic drugs, but I need the name brand. I tried the Generic Medication, but it gave me a stomach ache. What should I do?A. Poke yourself in the eyes.Q. What if I'm away from home and I get sick?A. You really shouldn't do that.Q. I think I need to see a specialist, but my doctor insists he can handle my problem. Can a general practitioner really perform a heart transplant right in his office?A. Hard to say, but considering that all you're risking is the $15 co-payment, there's no harm in giving him a shot at it.Q. Will health care be different in the next century?A. No. But if you call right now, you might get an appointment by then.",

"A man was sick and tired of going to work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed, Dear Lord, I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through, so please create a trade in our bodies.Now God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish.The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, awakened the kids, set out their school clothes, fed them breakfast, packed their lunches, drove them to school, came home and picked up the dry cleaning, took it to the cleaners and stopped at the bank to make a deposit, went grocery shopping, then drove home to put away the groceries, pay the bills and balance the check book. He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.Then it was already 1 p.m. and he hurried to make the beds, do the laundry, vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out cookies and milk and got the kids organized to do their homework, then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing.At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed.At 9 p.m. he was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.The next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said, Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back.The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied, My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll have to wait 9 months, though. You got pregnant last night.",

"A priest, a Pentecostal preacher and a rabbi all served as chaplains to the students of Northern Michigan University in Marquette. They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear. One thing led to another, and they decided to do a seven-day experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear and preach to it.Seven days later, they're all together to discuss the experience. Father O'Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches, and has various bandages, goes first.Wellll, he says, in a fine Irish brouge, Ey wint oot into th' wooods to fynd me a bearr. Oond when Ey fund him Ey began to rread to him from the Baltimorre Catechism. Welll, thet bearr wanted naught to do wi' me und begun to slap me aboot. So I quick grrabbed me holy water and, THE SAINTS BE PRAISED, he became as gentle as a lamb. The bishop is cooming oot next wik to give him fierst communion und confierrmation.Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip. In his best fire and brimstone oratory he proclaimed, WELL, brothers, you KNOW that we don't sprinkle...WE DUNK! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to him from God's HOOOOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. I SAY NO! He wanted NOTHING to do with me. So I took HOOOLD of him and we began to rassle. We rassled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we come to a crick. So I quick DUNK him and BAPTIZE his hairy soul. An' jus like you sez, he wuz gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the week in fellowship, feasting on God's HOOOOLY word.They both look down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV's and monitors running in and out of him.The rabbi looks up and says, Oy! You don't know what tough is until you try to circumcise one of those creatures.",

"One day God was looking down at Earth and saw all of the rascally behavior that was going on. He decided to send an angel down to Earth to check it out, so he called one of His angels and sent the angel to Earth for a time.When he returned, he told God, Yes, it is bad on Earth; 95% are misbehaving and only 5% are not. God thought for a moment and said, Maybe I had better send down a second angel to get another opinion.So God called another angel and sent him to Earth for a time too. When the angel returned he went to God and said, Yes, it's true, the Earth is in decline; 95% are misbehaving, but 5% are being good.God was not pleased, so He decided to E-mail the 5% that were good, because He wanted to encourage them. Give them a little something to help them keep going. Do you know what the Email said? Just wondering, I didn't get one either.",

Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran 10 miles, and now I'm here.

I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but... Let me guess, the General interrupted, it broke down. No, said the G.I., there were so many dead horses in the road, it took forever to get around them.",

The driver of the Rolls, upset that he did not have a bed, sped away and went straight to the dealer, where he promptly ordered a bed to be installed in the back of his Rolls-Royce. The next morning, he returned to pick up his car, and the bed looked superb It came complete with silk sheets and a brass-trimmed headboard. It was clearly a bed fit for a Rolls-Royce. So the driver of the Rolls began searching for the Yugo. He drove around all day and finally found the Yugo late that night. It was parked, with all the windows fogged up from the inside. He got out and knocked on the window of the Yugo. When there wasn't any answer, he continued knocking and knocking until finally, the owner of the Yugo lowered the window, and stuck his soaking wet head out. I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce, the driver of the Rolls stated arrogantly. The driver of the Yugo looked at him narrowly and said, You got me out of the shower to tell me that?!?!",

Feeling puzzled, he turned to ask the hospital personnel:quot; What actually happened to these people? quot;Well..quot; replied the personnel, quot;The first man died from laughing too much at a joke.quot;quot;The second man died while telling a very funny joke.quot; quot;The last man..well, he died while taking a picture.

"Once there were twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a dilapidated old boat. It so happened that John's wife died the same day that Joe's boat sank.A few days later, a kindly old woman saw Joe and mistook him for John. She said, I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must just feel terrible.Joe thinking that she was talking about his boat, said, Hell no, in fact is I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing right from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish. She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy.I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to these four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow. The fools tried to get in her all at once and she split right up the middle. The old lady fainted.",

"There was a tradesman, a painter named Jack, who was very interested in making a dollar where he could. So he often would thin down his paint to make it go a wee bit further. As it happened, he got away with this for some time.Eventually the local church decided to do a big restoration project. Jack put in a painting bid and, because his price was so competitive, he got the job. And so he started, erecting the trestles and putting up the planks, and buying the paint and thinning it down with turpentine.Jack was up on the scaffolding, painting away, the job nearly done, when suddenly there was a horrendous clap of thunder.

"A Japanese company and an American company decided to have a canoe race on the Missouri River. Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race. On the big day the Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the American team became very discouraged and morally depressed. The American management decided the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found. A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was that the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and one person rowing. So American management hired a consulting company and paid them an incredible amount of money. They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. To prevent losing to the Japanese again next year, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the Rowing Team Quality First Program, with meetings, dinners and a free pen for the rower. We must give the rower the empowerment and enrichments through this quality program. The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment. Then they distributed the money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.",

"A rich guy was looking for excitement so he decided to put an ad in the newspaper. The ad said, I will give $10,000 to any person that can make my elephant jump.So the next day, people came from all over the world to try to get this elephant to jump. There were even hypnotists who tried, but no one could get that elephant to jump.Then a guy drives up in a blue Corvette and said, Are you the guy with the ad? The rich guy replied yes. Then the guy asked, Is that your elephant? Yes. The rich man replies. Then theguy went back to his car.He returned with a 2 by 4.

"Most people assume WWJD is for What would Jesus do?  But the initials really stand for What would Jesus drive?One theory is that Jesus would tool around in an old Plymouth because the Bible says God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden in a Fury.But in Psalm 83, the Almighty clearly owns a Pontiac and a Geo. The passage urges the Lord to pursue your enemies with your Tempest and terrify them with your Storm.Perhaps God favors Dodge pickup trucks, because Moses' followers are warned not to go up a mountain until the Ram's horn sounds a long blast.Some scholars insist that Jesus drove a Honda but didn't like to talk about it.  As proof, they cite a verse in St. John's gospel where Christ tells the crowd, For I did  not speak of my own Accord... Meanwhile, Moses rode an old British motorcycle, as evidenced by a Bible passage declaring that the roar of  Moses' Triumph is heard in the hills. Joshua drove a Triumph sports car with a hole in its muffler...Joshua's Triumph was heard throughout the land.And, following the Master's lead, the Apostles car pooled in a Honda... The Apostles were in one Accord.!!",

"Timmy was a little five year old boy that his Mom loved very much and, being a worrier, she was concerned about him walking to school when he started Kindergarten. She walked him to school a couple of days but when he came home one day, he told his mother that he did not want her walking him to school every day. He wanted to be like the big boys. He protested loudly, so she had an idea of how to handle it.She asked a neighbor, Mrs. Goodnest, if she would surreptitiously follow her son to school, at a distance behind him that he would not likely notice, but close enough to keep a watch on him. Mrs. Goodnest said that since she was up early with her toddler anyway, it would be a good way for them to get some exercise as well so she agreed.The next school day, Mrs. Goodnest and her little girl, Marcy, set out following behind Timmy as he walked to school with another neighbor boy he knew. She did this for the whole week.As the boys walked and chatted, kicking stones and twigs, the little friend of Timmy noticed that this same lady was following them as she seemed to do every day all week. Finally, he said to Timmy, Have you noticed that lady following us all week? Do you know her?Timmy nonchalantly replied, Yeah, I know who she is.The little friend said, Well who is she?That's just Shirley Goodnest, Timmy said. Shirley Goodnest!?  Who the heck is she and why is she following us?Well, Timmy explained, every night my Mom makes me say the 23rd Psalm with my prayers 'cuz she worries about me so much. And in it, the prayer psalm says, 'Shirley Goodnest and Marcy shall follow me all the days of my life', so I guess I'll just have to get used to it.",

"A parish priest was being honored at a dinner on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his arrival in that parish. A leading local politician, who was a member of the congregation, was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner, but he was delayed in traffic, so the priest decided to say his own few words while they waited.You will understand, he said, the seal of the confessional can never be broken, however I got my first impressions of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I can only hint vaguely about this, but when I came here 25 years ago I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first chap who entered my confessional told me how he had stolen a television set, and when stopped by the police, had almost murdered the officer! Further, he told me he had embezzled money from his place of business and had an affair with his boss's wife. I was appalled! But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that, and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of understanding and loving people.Just as the priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and give his talk.I'll never forget the first day our parish priest arrived in this parish, said the politician. In fact, I had the honour of being the first one to go to him in confession.",

The officer looks over at the woman and asks, Does your husband always talk to you this way, Ma'am? Oh, heavens no, officer. Only when he's been drinking.",

"THINK YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY.... check it out these actual cases.Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask.A postmortem test revealed that the man died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clothed diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire.You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.___________________________________________Still think you're having a bad day?A man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, his wife nearby in the kitchen. While racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors.His wife, hearing the crash, ran in the room to find her husband cut and bleeding, the motorcycle, and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the paramedics and escort them to her husband.While the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to right the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet.After being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the butt between his legs.The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, sheonce again phoned for an ambulance. The same paramedic crew was dispatched.As the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them.They started laughing so hard, one slipped, the stretcher and dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.______________________________________________Still having a bad day?

"I  was looking at this parked, motorized wheelchair once, and I noticed that it had a dial on it to control it's speed.  At one end there was a turtle, and at the other end there was a rabbit.  I just assumed at first that the turtle was representing the slower speed, and that the rabbit was for the faster speed, but then I remembered who won when those two animals raced.I think that it would be cool if cars used this same system too.  You know, you get pulled over by a police officer and he says to you Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you were speeding?  We had you clocked  on our radar at going 'Rabbit' and I'm sure that you know the posted speed limit here is only 'Raccoon'.  Now we'll just let you off with a warning this time since you were only going a 'hare' over the speed limit.",

"Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a season when neither the Browns nor the Steelers made the post season playoffs. It seemed so unusual that the management of both teams got together and decided that there should be some sort of competition between the two teams, because of their great rivalry. So, they decided on a week long ice fishing competition.  The team that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. So on a cold freezing day on Lake Erie they began their contest. The first day after 8 hours of fishing the Browns had caught 0 fish and the Steelers had 100. At the end of the 2nd day the Browns had caught 0 fish and the Steelers 200. That evening the Browns coach got his team together and said, I suspect some kind of cheating is taking place.  So the next morning, he dressed one of his players in black and yellow and sent him over to the Steelers camp to act as a spy. At the end of the day he came back to report to the coach.  The coach asked, Well, how about it, are they cheating? They sure are! the player reported, They're cutting holes in the ice.",

"This man goes to confession and says, Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

The priest sighs and tells him to continue.Well, father, I played golf on Sunday with my buddies instead of going to church.The priest says, And you got upset over that, and swore? The man replied, No, that wasn't why I swore. On the first tee I duck-hooked my drive well left into the trees.The priest said, And that's when you swore. The man replied, a little testily because of the constant interruptions, No, it wasn't. When I walked up the fairway, I noticed my ball got a lucky bounce and I had a clear shot to the green. However, before I could hit the ball, a squirrel ran by and grabbed my ball and scurried up a tree. The priest asked, Is that when you said the 'F-word'? The man replied, No, because an eagle then flew by and caught the squirrel in its sharp talons and flew away. The priest let out a breath and queried, Is that when you swore?The man replied, No, because the eagle flew over the green and the dying squirrel let go of my golf ball and it landed within 5 inches of the hole. The priest screamed, Don't tell me you missed the fucking putt!",

There was a red ribbon on his left foot, and a blue ribbon on his right foot.As I was wondering what the ribbons were for, the store owner walked up to me.

"Dear Friend, The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a Honk if you love Jesus bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.Boy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience followed! I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is...and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus!While I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, For the love of GOD! GO! GO! Jesus Christ, GO! What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love!There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach... I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something.Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing ... he was enjoying this religious experience, too! A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning, and drove on through the intersection.I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad that had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks! Love,Grandma",

"THE COMMON FART The Common Fart is the fart heard most often. It is a very close relative of the Ripper, but is released with less force. It is usually heard in groups where people aren't yet comfortable with farting amongst each other. Therefore, one person in the group gets up some nerve and releases this common-sounding fart in such a manner that everyone now feels comfortable with group flatulence.. Usually there is no smell with the Common Fart. THE ANXIOUS FART The Anxious Fart is let in a place where someone does not want the fart to be heard. You may have seen men and women in book stores or grocery stores, or even on the street, letting these farts. They are generally controlled, usually barely audible, and require much skill to master. THE COUGHING FART The Coughing Fart is one that the farter tries to cover up with a cough. My dad used to let these farts all the time when he worked at the Bingo Hall. He would stand at the back of the hall and cough, just as a nice common fart was let. It can be embarrassing for the farter, and those around the farter, if the timing is off at all, or if the fart is longer than anticipated. THE WET FART The Wet Fart is one that sounds quite juicy. Quite often this fart is cause for alarm, and an indication that a trip to the toilet is imminent.THE BLOWER This fart is similar to the ripper, except it has a bit of a hollow, windy sound to it. This is due to farter blowing all the gas out quickly. This fart will almost always get a laugh. TIGHT BUN FART This fart is always recognizable. It sounds like the farter's buns were so tight that he/she was in pain while farting. THE RIPPEROne of the best farts around is The Ripper. It is loud, rough, and always raises an eyebrow or two. Characteristics of The Ripper often show up in other farts, but make no mistake - this fart is a single, powerful gas-bubble that comes screaming from the farter's butt",

You can go inside and talk to my owner if you want to buy me. The man asked, How come you can talk? The dog answered, I was a secret CIA experiment. They altered my genes and I used to be a covert agent. I led to many gang busts and stopped a lot of assassination attempts. Once they learned I told my owner about the cases, they kicked me out and now I am stuck here.The man was in awe and went to talk to the dog's owner Bob.

"There was a tailor in a little village who was known to brutally attack and torture his wife by clobbering her head with a club and stab her with needles. The villagers decided that they should bring the tailor to justice, so they arrested him and took him to the village elders. The elders believed everyone should have a second chance, so they gave the tailor one last chance. They told him, We will give you one last chance for you and your wife to share sorrow and happiness together. If you don't, you will be sent to the gallows to be hanged. The villagers gleefully looked on as the tailor somberly walked home.  The first few weeks went well, but after that, the tailor started clobbering his wife on the head again. When he was brought to the village elders and asked for his alibi, the tailor said, I stayed true to my word, for when I hit my wife on the head, I am full of happiness and she is full of sorrow. When I miss, she is full of happiness and I am full of sorrow. The elders had no choice but to let him go.",

"1. I had someone ask for an aisle seat so that their hair wouldn't get messed up by being near the window.2. A client called in inquiring about a package to Hawaii. After going over all the cost information, she asked, Would it be cheaper to fly to California and then take the train to Hawaii?3. I got a call from a woman who wanted to go to Capetown. I started to explain the length of the flight and the passport information when she interrupted me with I'm not trying to make you look stupid, but Cape Town is in Massachusetts. Without trying to make her look like the stupid one, I calmly explained, Cape Cod is in Massachusetts, Capetown is in Africa.Her response was click.4. A man called, furious about a Florida package we did. I asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando. He said he was expecting an ocean-view room. I tried to explain that is not possible, since Orlando is in the middle of the state. He replied, Don't lie to me. I looked on the map and Florida is a very thin state.5. I got a call from a man who asked, Is it possible to see England from Canada? I said, No. He said, But they look so close on the map.6. Another man called and asked if he could rent a car in Dallas. When I pulled up the reservation, I noticed he had a 1-hour lay over in Dallas. When I asked him why he wanted to rent a car, he said, I heard Dallas was a big airport, and I need a car to drive between the gates to save time.7. A nice lady just called. She needed to know how it was possible that her flight from Detroit left at 8:20am and got into Chicago at 8:33am. I tried to explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of Illinois, but she could not understand the concept of time zones. Finally I told her the plane went very fast, and she bought that!8. A woman called and asked, Do airlines put your physical descriptionon your bag so they know whose luggage belongs to who? I said, No, why do you ask? She replied, Well, when I checked in with the airline, they put a tag on my luggage that said FAT, and I'm overweight, is there any connection? After putting her on hold for a minute while I looked into it,  I came back and explained that the city code for Fresno is FAT, and that the airline was just putting a destination tag on her luggage.9. I just got off the phone with a man who asked, How do I know which plane to get on? I asked him what exactly he meant, to which he replied, I was told my flight number is 823, but none of these darn planes have numbers on them.10. A woman called and said, I need to fly to Pepsi-cola on one of those computer planes. I asked if she meant to fly to Pensacola on a commuter plane. She said, Yeah, whatever.11. A businessman called and had a question about the documents he needed in order to fly to China. After a lengthy discussion about passports, I reminded him he needed a visa. Oh no I don't, I've been to China manytimes and never had to have one of those. I double-checked and sure enough, his stay required a visa. When I told him this he said, Look, I've been to China four times and every time they have accepted my American Express.12. A woman called to make reservations. I want to go from Chicago to Hippopotamus, New York. The agent was at a loss for words. Finally, the agent asked, Are you sure that's the name of the town? Yes, what flights do you have? replied the customer. After some searching, the agent came back with, I'm sorry, ma'am, I've looked up every airport code in the country and can't find a Hippopotamus anywhere. The customer retorted,Oh don't be silly. Everyone knows where it is. Check your map! The agent scoured a map of the state of New York and finally offered, You don't mean Buffalo, do you? That's it! I knew it was a big animal!",
"A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door. Hurry! she said, stand in the corner. She quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then she dusted him with talcum powder. Don't move until I tell you to, she whispered. Just pretend you're a statue. What's this, honey? the husband inquired as he entered the room. Oh, it's just a statue, she replied nonchalantly. The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too. No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk. Here, he said to the 'statue', eat something.

"A city slicker decided to buy himself a pig, so he drove to the country until he saw a sign that said PIGS FOR SALE. Turning into the driveway, he spotted the farmer, told him what he wanted, and they agreed on a price. They went to the barn where the farmer picked up a pig by the tail with his teeth. Yup, that there swine weighs 74 pounds. Noticing the man's bewilderment, the farmer explained that it was a family trait, passed on through generations, to be able to precisely weigh pigs in that manner.  The city slicker, however, insisted on a second opinion. So the farmer called his son over and the boy came up with the same result.  The man was ready to buy the pig on the spot, but the farmer said to go on up to the house and pay his wife. The man could then bring the receipt back to the farmer and take the pig.  After a long wait, the city slicker finally returned, but without a receipt. What's the problem, son? asked the farmer. I went up there like you said, said the man, And your wife was too busy. Busy doing what? Well, don't quote me on this, he warned, But I think she was weighing the milkman.",

"An older man, Mr.Brown, in his hospital room knew that he was nearing his death, so he called in the three people that he trusted the most - his doctor, his pastor, and his lawyer. They were all waiting sadly outside of his room, when he called in his doctor. The doctor walked in slowly expecting to have to reassure the diagnosis. To his surprise, his patient handed him $30,000 in cash. Mr. Brown simply said, When I die, put this in my coffin.        The doctor walked walked out confused and told the pastor that Mr. Brown was ready for him. Now the pastor walked in expecting for Mr. Brown to confess every sin he ever committed in hopes of ending it right. To his surprise, the old man handed him another $30,000; Mr. Brown simply repeated himself.    His pastor walked out searching the possibilities and told the lawyer that his client was ready for him. The lawyer walked in expecting that his client would want to review his will. To his surprise, Mr. Brown handed him another $30,000 and calmly repeated himself.   Later that night, Mr. Brown passed on. 3 days later his lamenting family members set up a small funeral in his honor. The lawyer, the doctor, and the pastor all showed up. After the funeral, they gathered and discussed what they did with the small fortunes so simply handed to them.   The doctor spoke up with a look of defeat on his face, I was going to return the money, but that poor little girl could not afford the operation. The pastor spoke up with a similar look, I was going to return the money, but we were so close to the price of the new sanctuary. The lawyer spoke up with the look of triumph on his face, I knew that ya'll would fail, so I wrote a check for $90,000 to cover all of our debt.",

"Once upon a time, there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter.However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly started to fly south. In a short time, ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen.A cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow. The sparrow thought it was the end. But, the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. Warm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing. Just then a large cat came by and, hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds.The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.The moral of the story:1.) Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy.2.) Everyone who gets you out of the crap is not necessarily your friend.3.)

The dad said to him, It means 'doormat'. Later, the boy went into the kitchen and his mum was cooking eggs. She dropped one and yelled angrily, Tit! The boy asked her, What does 'tit' mean? The mum told him, It's another word for 'eggs'. The dad came back home later and went upstairs. The boy followed him up. The dad went into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Seconds later he cut himself shaving and shouted, Fuck! The boy asked him when he came out, What does 'fuck' mean? The dad told him, It's another word for 'shaving'. A few days later, the doorbell rang and the boy answered the door. A police officer was standing on the porch. The boy, smiling said, Hi bastard, come in! Wipe your feet on the shit. My mum is in the kitchen frying her tits and my dad is upstairs fucking himself.",

"I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this yellow construction paper?",
"In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com, did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. She said unto Abraham, her husband, Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent? And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, How, Dear? And Dot replied, I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable . Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks. Dot did say, Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others. And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known eBay he said, we need a name that reflects what we are, and Dot replied, Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators. YAHOO, said Abraham. And that is how it all began, It wasn't Al Gore after all.",

"A wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a junior high school. He spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment.Then a new school year began.

Stopping them, he said, You kids are a lot of fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing. The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trash cans.After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face. This recession's really putting a big dent in my income, he told them. From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans.The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they did accept his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street.Look, he said, I haven't received my Social Security check yet, so I'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents. Will that be okay? A lousy quarter? the drum leader exclaimed. If you think we're going to waste our time, beating these cans around for a quarter, you're nuts! No way, mister. We quit!

"The children begged for a hamster, and after the usual fervent vows that they alone would care for it, they got one. They named it Danny. Two months later, when Mom found herself responsible for cleaning and feeding the creature, she located a prospective new home for it. The children took the news of Danny's imminent departure quite well, though one of them remarked, He's been around here a long time - we'll miss him. Yes, Mom replied, But he's too much work for one person, and since I'm that one person, I say he goes. Another child offered, Well, maybe if he wouldn't eat so much and wouldn't be so messy, we could keep him. But Mom was firm. It's time to take Danny to his new home now, she insisted. Go and get his cage. With one voice and in tearful outrage the children shouted, Danny? We thought you said Daddy!",

"A rich American tourist was holidaying in Rome, and was intent on seeing the Pope. There he stood, in a big long line with a rather expensive suit on, hoping the Pope would notice how smart he was and perhaps talk a few words with him.As the Pope made his way slowly down the line, he walked right past the American, hardly even noticing him. The Pope then stopped next to a low-life sot, leaned over and whispered something in the sot's ear, and made his way on again.This really angered the American. After speaking with the drunkard, the American agreed to pay $1000 dollars to exchange clothing, in the hope that the Pope would speak to him the next day. The next morning the American stood in the line, waiting to see the Pope and hopefully exchange a few words. The Pope was making his way slowly up to the American. When he finally reached him, he leaned over to the American and spoke softly into his ear..I thought I told you yesterday to get out of here.",

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, and he couldn't find a quarterback that would ensure a SuperBowl win.Then one night, watching CNN, he saw a war zone in Bosnia. In the background, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th story window 200 yards away!

You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces of bread at the same time. If Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million, but would be faster than any other single-slice toaster in the world. If the Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth, and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified, government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it. If the NSA made toasters... Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security. If Sony made toasters... The ToastMan, which would be barely larger than the single piece of bread it is meant to toast, and it could be conveniently attached to your belt. If Timex made toasters... They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. If Fisher Price made toasters... 'Baby's First Toaster' would have a hand-crank that you turn to toast the bread and then pops it up like a jack-in-the-box. If Microsoft made toasters... Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it, anyway. Toaster '02 would weigh 15,000 pounds , draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that lets you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good bread only works with their toasters. If Apple made toasters... It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but five years earlier.",
"An old country boy pulls up to a bait shop with a stringer full of fish.  A man, noticing the stringer, asks him where he caught all the fish.

They row out to the middle of the water and the good ole boy pulls out a stick of dynamite, lights it and throws it in the water.  All kinds of fish float to the surface and he starts pulling them in the boat. His buddy is shocked! He says, You know, what you're doing is not only improper but highly illegal.

"A man worked at a gas station out in the middle of nowhere. One day when he was driving home from work, he ran out of gas .  So the man walks and walks and eventually he comes upon a monastery.He asks a monk at the monastery, Can I stay here over night? My car ran out of gas.The monk replies, You may; but you musn't come out of your room between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 am.The man replies, That's fine with me.  The monk takes him to his room, and the man falls asleep.About 12 midnight the man is roused from his sleep by a horrible groaning noise that was coming from the basement.  He gets out of his bed to see what it is, but remembers the monk saying that he couldn't leave his room between 12 and 6 am.  The groaning keeps the man awake all night long until it finally stops at 6. The next morning the man asks the monk from yesterday, What was that racket coming from the basement?I can't tell you. You're not a monk, the monk replies.So the man gets some gas from the monk, fuels up his car and drives home. For a year that groaning noise haunts him. The man decides to become a monk so he can find out what it was.  The man goes to monk school, and afterwards goes to the monastery that he arrived at a year ago.He asks a monk there, Can I stay here for the night?The monk replies, Yes, but do not come out of your room between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 am.Why not? the man asks.I can't tell you.  You're not a monk, the monk replies.Yes, I am, the man says.Well, just don't come out, the monk says.That night the man is awakened by the groaning noise.  The man thinks, 'I'm a monk, so I can go and see what it is. The man walks down to the first floor and opens the door to the basement.It had been bugging him for sooo long what the groaning noise was in the basement. It had haunted his dreams, scared him in the day, and he had gone through monk school and everything JUST to see what the groaning noise was in the basement. It was a strange noise, and he was finally able to see what it was, after a whole 365 days. He was just so excited to know what it was, so he wouldn't be haunted anymore. So he went down to the basement, sighed, and slowly creaked the door open to see what he had been wanting to see for the longest time.Do you know what the man saw in the basement?  I can't tell you.

"19 Ways To Annoy/Confuse Santa Claus----------------------------------------------------------1.)  Instead of milk and cookies, leave him a salad, and a note explaining that you think he could stand to lose a few pounds. 2.)  While he's in the house, go find his sleigh and write him a speeding ticket. 3.)  Leave him a note, explaining that you've gone away for the holidays. Ask if he would mind watering your plants. 4.)  While he's in the house, replace all his reindeer with exact replicas. Then wait and see what happens when he tries to get them to fly. 5.)  Keep an angry bull in your living room. If you think a bull goes crazy when he sees a little red cape, wait until he sees that big, red Santa suit! 6.)  Build an army of mean-looking snowmen on the roof, holding signs that say We hate Christmas, and Go away Santa. 7.)  Leave a note by the telephone, telling Santa that Mrs. Claus called and wanted to remind him to pick up some milk and a loaf of bread on his way home. 8.)  While he's in the house, find the sleigh and sit in it. As soon as he comes back and sees you, tell him that he shouldn't have missed that last payment, and take off. 9.)  Leave a plate filled with cookies and a glass of milk out, with a note that says, For The Tooth Fairy.10.) Leave another plate out with half a stale cookie and a few drops of skim milk in a dirty glass with a note that says, For Santa. 11.) Take everything out of your house as if it's just been robbed and when Santa arrives, show up dressed like a policeman and say, Well, well. They always return to the scene of the crime. 12.) Leave out a copy of your Christmas list with last-minute changes and corrections. 13.) While he's in the house, cover the top of the chimney with barbed wire. 14.) Leave lots of hunting trophies and guns out where Santa's sure to see them. Go outside, yell, Ooh! Look! A deer! And he's got a red nose! and fire a gun. 15.) Leave Santa a note, explaining that you've moved. Include a map with unclear and hard-to-read directions to your new house. 16.) Set a bear trap at the bottom of the chimney. Wait for Santa to get caught in it, and then explain that you're sorry, but from a distance, he looked like a bear. 17.) Leave out a Santa suit, with a dry-cleaning bill. 18.) Paint hoof-prints all over your face and clothes. While he's in the house, go out on the roof. When he comes back up, act like you've been trampled. Threaten to sue. 19.) Instead of ornaments, decorate your tree with Easter eggs. Dress up like the Easter Bunny. Wait for Santa to come and then say, This neighborhood ain't big enough for the both of us.",

The father of the family wasn't making very much money and he decided that he and his family were going to move to America in order to live a better life, so the family moved to America.The Mexican man didn't found a job there, and his family was starving, so he went outside, climbed a hill, and bent down under a pine tree to pray for God to help his family get through their situation. While he was praying, a black man was coming out of a grocery store on top of the hill. He had a sack in one hand with a wheel of cheese in it. The bag was heavy, and right as the Mexican man was getting up from praying, the bag broke and the wheel of cheese rolled down the hill.The Mexican man saw it, picked it up, and ran non-stop to his home. He gave it to his wife and told her to make nacho cheese out of it. His wife said, Well, why can't we make something else out of it? and he said, Cause all the way home God was tellin' me, that's nacho cheese, that's nacho cheese!",

"We have all had bad dates, but this takes the cake. This just tells you how tough it is to be single nowadays. This was on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Jay went into the audience to find the most embarrassing first date that a woman ever had. The winner described her worst first date experience. There absolutely no question as to why her tale took the prize! She said it was midwinter, snowing and quite cold; and the guy had taken her skiing to Lake Arrowhead. It was a day trip . They were strangers, after all, and truly had never met before. The outing was fun but relatively uneventful until they were headed home late that afternoon. They were driving back down the mountain, when she gradually began to realize that she should not have had that extra latte. They were about an hour away from anywhere with a rest room and in the middle of nowhere! Her companion suggested she try to hold it, which she did for a while. Unfortunately, because of the heavy snow and slow going, there came a point where she told him that he had better stop and let her pee beside the road, or it would be the front seat of his car. They stopped and she quickly crawled out beside the car, yanked her pants down and started. Unfortunately, in the deep snow she didn't have good footing, so she let her butt rest against the rear fender to steady herself. Her companion stood on the side of the car watching for traffic and indeed was a real gentleman and refrained from peeking. All she could think about was the relief she felt despite the rather embarrassing nature of the situation. Upon finishing however, she soon became aware of another sensation. As she bent to pull up her pants, the young lady discovered her buttocks were firmly glued against the car's fender. Thoughts of tongues frozen to pump handles immediately came to mind as she attempted to disengage her flesh from the icy metal. It was quickly apparent that she had a brand new problem due to the extreme cold.Horrified by her plight and yet aware of the humor she answered her date's concerns about what is taking so long? with a reply that indeed, she was freezing her butt off and in need of some assistance! He came around the car as she tried to cover herself with her sweater and then, as she looked imploringly into his eyes, he burst out laughing. She too, got the giggles and when they finally managed to compose themselves, they assessed her dilemma. Obviously, as hysterical as the situation was, they also were faced with a real problem. Both agreed it would take something hot to free her chilly cheeks from the grip of the icy metal! Thinking about what had gotten her into the predicament in the first place, both quickly realized that there was only one way to get her free. So, as she looked the other way, her first-time date proceeded to unzip his pants and pee her butt off the fender. As for the Tonight Show; she took the prize hands down - or perhaps that should be pants down. And you thought your first date was embarrassing. Jay Leno's comment? This gives a whole new meaning to being pissed off.",
"Once in medieval times...there was a King who was getting sort of bored after dinner one night. He decided to hold a contest of who at the court had the mightiest Weapon.The first knight stood up and proclaimed that he had the mightiest weapon... he pulled down his pants and tied a 5 pound weight around it. The weapon doth rose.The crowds cheered...the women swooned...the children waved multi-colored banners...and the band played appropriate music.Another knight stood up and yelled that he had the mightiest weapon. He dropped his pants and tied a 10 pound weight to himself. The weapon doth rose. The crowds cheered...the women swooned...the children waved multi-colored banners... and the band played appropriate music.After several more knights tried to prove their superiority...the King finally spoke out. I have the mightiest weapon of them all! He dropped his pants and tied, not a 10 pound, not a 20 pound, not ever a 30 pound, but a 40 pound weight to himself. The weapon doth rose.The crowds cheered...the women swooned...the children waved multi-colored banners... and the band played God Save the Queen.",

"Sometime after Sidney died, his widow, Tillie, was finally able to speak about what a thoughtful and wonderful man her late husband had been.Sidney thought of everything, she told them. Just before he died, Sidney called me to his bedside. He handed me three envelopes.`Tillie,' he told me, 'I have put all my last wishes in these three envelopes. After I am dead, please open them and do exactly as I have instructed. Then I can rest in peace'.What was in the envelopes? her friends asked.The first envelope contained $5,000 with a note, 'Please use this money to buy a nice casket.' So I bought a beautiful mahogany casket with such a comfortable lining that I know Sidney is resting very comfortably.The second envelope contained $10,000 with a note, 'Please use this for a nice funeral.' I arranged Sidney a very dignified funeral and bought all his favorite foods for everyone attending.And the third envelope? asked her friends.The third envelope contained $25,000 with a note, 'Please use this to buy a nice stone.'Holding her hand in the air, Tillie said, So, do you like my stone? showing off her ten carat diamond ring...",

"It's time once again to consider the candidates for the annual Stella Awards. The Stella's are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful lawsuits in the United States.The following are this year's candidates:1. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a nightclub in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.2. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next-door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.3. A 19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub caps.4. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 a! after she slipped on a soft drink spill and broke her coccyx . The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.5. Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't reenter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of $500,000.6. A jury of her peers awarded Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, $780,000 after breaking her ankle by tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son.7. This year's favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.",

"God was missing for six days. Eventually, Michael, the archangel, found him, resting on the seventh day. He inquired of God. Where have you been?God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction, and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds, Look, Michael. Look what I've made.Archangel Michael looked puzzled, and said, What is it?It's a planet, replied God, and I've put Life on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.Balance? inquired Michael, still confused.God explained, pointing to different parts of earth.  For example, northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while  southern Europe is going to be poor. Over there I've placed a continent of white people, and over there is a continent of black people. Balance in all things, God continued pointing to different countries. This one will be extremely hot, while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to a land area and said, What's that one?Ah, said God That's Washington State, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful mountains, rivers and streams, lakes, forests, hills, plains, and coulees. The people from Washington State are going to be handsome, modest, intelligent, and humorous, and they are going to be found traveling the world. They will be extremely sociable, hardworking, high achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats, and carriers of peace.Michael gasped in wonder and admiration, but then proclaimed, What about balance, God? You said there would be balance.God smiled, then said, There is another Washington... wait until you see the idiots I put there!",

"A young doctor went to look at a practice that was up for sale in a very remote part of West Virginia. It looked perfect with a comfortable house, fully equipped lab, and lovely gardens.The old doctor even quoted a very affordable price. This looks great, said the young doctor. I just can't figure out how you're able to have such a nice set up with so few people to practice on.It's just simple common sense, and a strong work ethic, replied the older medico. For example, most folks around here take a couple weeks off for a vacation every year. My wife and I, however, spend the time at home, gardening and putting things in order. Our herb garden gives us a huge harvest because of that, so we mix the herbs and boil them up for my secret tonic.But that doesn't explain this fine house and all this land, said the younger man.The elder doc replied, That's where going that extra bit pays off. I run into my patients at church, at the store, whatever, right after they get back from their vacations. I tell them they don't look too good, and they usually say that their vacation took a lot out of them.He continued, I'll agree with them, then invite them to stop around to my office for some of my old fashioned tonic, and at ten bucks a bottle, it can add up really fast!Of course, that's just the beginning. A few weeks after a patient buys the tonic, I comment on how much better they're looking, so that they feel like the tonic is working. Then I have them stop by the office for a complete physical exam, just to make sure everything is alright.I also tell them to bring in a specimen, and this way I get my bottles back!",

She asked the bartender why, and he replied,Every time someone lifts the fig leaf, the lights go out.",
"This Is A True Story, It Really HappenedAn elderly lady did her shopping and, upon returning to her car, found four males in the act of leaving with her car.

Get out of the car, scumbags !The four men didn't wait for a second invitation but got out and ran like mad, whereupon the lady, somewhat shaken, proceeded to load her shopping bags into the back of the car and get into the driver's seat.She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition. She tried and tried, and then it dawned on her why. A few minutes later she found her own car parked four or five spaces farther down.She loaded her bags into her car and drove to the police station.The sergeant to whom she told the story nearly tore himself in two with laughter and pointed to the other end of the counter, where four pale white males were reporting a car jacking by a mad elderly woman described as white, less than 5' tall, glasses, and curly white hair carrying a large handgun.",

"Dear Mom and Dad,Our scoutmaster told us all to write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only one of our tents and two of our sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily none us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened.Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search and rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. Scoutmaster Long got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Don't worry it didn't hurt anything very much, just burned part of the chow hall. Scoutmaster Long said we will have to wash the black stuff off of the meat that used to be in the cooler but he said it would be alright. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back.We will come home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Long gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Long said that with a car that old, you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with ten people in the car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Long is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. Especially when that wheel came off when we were going around this steep curve. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. He only lets him drive on them mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. I'm glad Terry wasn't driving when the wheel came off. We probably would have went off the cliff.This morning all the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Long wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of the cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Long isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. When I can I will tell you how we lost them. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.Guess what? We have passed all our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we all got to see how a tourniquet works. Also, Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Long said it was probably just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. He said they got sick that way sometimes from the food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and became our scoutmaster.He said he sure figured out how to get things done while he was doing his time.I have to go now, we are going to town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Scoutmaster Long has a big pistol and he is going to teach us how to shoot it. The reason we have to buy more bullets is Jimmy threw all of the others in the fire. It sure was a loud noise. It was neat though, it sounded like a bunch of bees flying out of the fire. Scoutmaster Long said not to tell any one because some of the tents got holes in them from the bullets and he said he is not supposed to have a gun but he didn't say why. Don't worry we put duct tape over the holes in the tents. Scoutmaster Long says that is the best stuff to fix anything. He should know, the seats in his old car has it all over them, so does the dash.Don't worry about anything. We are fine.Love, Cole P.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?",

"A general store owner hired a young female clerk who liked to wear very short skirts and thong panties. One day a young man entered the store, glanced at the clerk and glanced at the loaves of bread behind the counter. Noticing the length of her skirt  and the location of the raisin bread, he had a brilliant idea. I'd like some raisin bread please, the man said. The clerk nodded and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which was located on the very top shelf. The young man standing almost directly beneath her is provided with an excellent view, just as he surmised he would be. Once she descended the ladder he mused that he really should get two loaves as he was having company for dinner. As the clerk retrieved the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers noticed what was going on. Thinking quickly, he requested his own loaf of raisin bread so he could continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder the young lady seemed to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon each person is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down. After many trips she was tired, irritated, and thinking that she should really  try this bread for herself. Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stopped and fumed, glaring at the men standing below. She noticed an elderly man standing amongst the crowd staring up at her. Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells, Is yours raisin, too? No, croaked the old man, but it's startin' to twitch.",

Very good, Janie, said the teacher. Then she drew a picture of a pig, and a little boy answered correctly. She drew several other barnyard animals and was unable to stump the class. Finally, she decided to try something a little more difficult. She drew a stag with a large spread of antlers. The kids just stared, but nobody offered an answer.

"A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.",
"Justification for beer and ice cream! But stay away from the pizza!As we all know, it takes 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade. Translated into meaningful terms, this means that if you eat a very cold dessert , the natural processes which raise the consumed dessert to body temperature during the digestive cycle literally suck the calories out of the only available source, your body fat.For example, a dessert served and eaten at near 0 degrees C  will, in a short time, be raised to the normal body temperature of 37 degrees C .  For each gram of dessert eaten, that process takes approximately 37 calories as stated above.  The average dessert portion is 6 oz, or 168 grams.  Therefore, by operation of thermodynamic law, 6,216 calories  are extracted from body fat as the dessert's temperature is normalized.Allowing for the 1,200 latent calories in the dessert, the net calorie loss is approximately 5,000 calories.Obviously, the more cold dessert you eat,the better off you are and the faster you will lose weight, if that is your goal.This process works equally well when drinking very cold beer in frosted glasses.  Each ounce of beer contains 16 latent calories, but extracts 1,036 calories  in the temperature normalizing process.  Thus the net calorie loss per ounce of beer is 1,020 calories.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that 12,240 calories  are extracted from the body in the process of drinking a can of beer.Frozen desserts, e.g., ice cream, are even more beneficial, since it takes 83 cal./gm to melt them  and an additional 37 cal./gm to further raise them to body temperature. The results here are really remarkable, and it beats running hands down.Unfortunately, for those who eat pizza as an excuse to drink beer, pizza  induces an opposite effect.  But, thankfully, as the astute reader should have already reasoned, the obvious solution is to drink a lot of beer with pizza and follow up immediately with large bowls of ice cream.We could all be thin if we were to adhere religiously to a pizza, beer, and ice cream diet.Happy eating!",
"When I was a young turkey, new to the coop, my big brother Tom took me out on the stoop, then he sat me down, and he spoke real slow, and he told me there was something that I had to know. His look and his tone I will always remember, when he told me of the horrors of.... Black November. Come around August, now listen to me, each day you'll get six meals instead of just three, and soon you'll be thick, where once you were thin, and you'll grow a big rubbery thing under your chin. And then one morning, when you're warm in your bed, in will burst the farmer's wife, and hack off your head, Then she'll pluck out all your feathers so you're bald 'n pink, and scoop out all your insides and leave ya lyin' in the sink. And then comes the worst part, he said not bluffing, She'll spread your cheeks and pack your rear with stuffing. Well, the rest of his words were too grim to repeat, and as I sat on the stoop like a winged piece of meat, I decided on the spot that to avoid being cooked, I'd have to lay low and remain overlooked. I began a new diet of nuts and granola, high-roughage salads, juice and diet cola. And as they ate pastries, chocolates and crepes, I stayed in my room doing my fitness tapes. I maintained my weight of two pounds and a half, and tried not to notice when the bigger birds laughed. But 'twas I who was laughing, under my breath, as they chomped and they chewed, ever closer to death. And sure enough when Black November rolled around, I was the last turkey left in the entire compound. So now I'm a pet in the farmer's wife's lap. I haven't a worry, so I eat and I nap. She held me today, while sewing and humming, and smiled at me and said..... Christmas is coming...",

"BE SURE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his bus, and drove off along the route. No problems for the first few stops-a few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well. At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on. Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and said, Big John doesn't pay! and sat down at the back. Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was. Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.The next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a showoff refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth. This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleepo ver the way Big John was taking advantage of him.Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong  invested a lot of money as well ; what's more, he felt really good about himself.So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said, Big John doesn't pay!, the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, And why not?  With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, Big John has a bus pass !Moral of the story:--  Be sure there is a problem in the first place before working hard to solve one",

Still, a job's a job, he thought.As he went about his route, he stopped and picked up twin girls. These girls were rather portly, and as they entered the bus the first one said, My name's Patty. The man asked the second twin her name and she said, My name's Patty also.Further along, there was a boy who was trying to put on a James Dean-esque cool image. As he got on the bus, he said, Yo! I'm Leonard T. He sat in the seat right behind the driver, so the driver could see him in his mirror.They were almost back to the school, and made one last stop. The kid who got on announced, I'm Ross... and I'm special.As they made their way back to the school, the driver noticed to his disgust that the kid sitting right behing him had removed one shoe to reveal a horrible case of bunions, which he was picking at.As soon as they got to school, the man went to the principal's office, threw down the bus keys on his desk, and announced he was quitting. Is something wrong? asked the principal?I can't take this! yelled the man. I've got two all beef Pattys, special Ross, Leonard T. picking bunions on a Sesame Street bus!",

I watched as George Sr., Bill Clinton, and George Jr. all walked through a bright door with an angel as an escort.  I then gave Peter my name at the gate.  He checked his book and said I'm sorry you missed it by an inch, but there is a way to get into heaven if you walk around with an ugly girl for 100 years.  I was confused and started complaining that this was not the way heaven was supposed to work.  Peter took me to a window next to the bright door where I saw men and women walking around with ugly people as their penance.  I became curious about the Presidents before me and asked about George Sr.  Peter informed me that he missed it by an inch.  He then pointed in the window as I saw George Sr. walking with some really ugly woman. I then asked about his son, George Jr.  Peter said that he had missed it by an inch.  Sure enough, I looked in the window and saw our President walking with what I guess was a woman .  As I was looking, I saw Bill Clinton walking with Britney Spears.  I exclaimed to Peter that it was not fair.  I asked what about Bill Clinton.  Peter looked in his book and said that he could not find his name.  Then I said what about Britney Spears.

"Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who is used to the procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood which will bend under stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if things go wrong.What YOU carry is a ten foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is looped about the tiger's neck and acts as a giant choke-chain, but the clip is there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it. You practice this beforehand till you're sure you've got it right.Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the tiger's mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, OUTside the cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you're standing next to one.Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation. Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case, the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. This is generally done by wrapping the chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable, whereas one will not.It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually  be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered. If they are they don't get taken for walks.They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn't put it by me.

It's only a matter of time before that powerful engine of productivity begins to sputter and fail.What could cause such a sharp turnaround? High interest rates? Increased unemployment? Lower productivity? No, it's something much more economically debilitating - and permanent.Three American lawyers have become the first foreign attorneys permitted to practice law in Japan. What's more, two of them are from New York!The decline has begun.Japan has one attorney for every 10,000 residents, compared to the U.S. ratio of one attorney for every 390 residents. For every 100 attorneys trained in Japan, there are 1,000 engineers. In the United States, that ratio is reversed.But a law that became effective on April 1 permits foreigners to practice in Japan for the first time since 1955. Already, an additional 20 American and six British lawyers have applied for permission to open practices in Japan.If anything can slow the Japanese economy, it's the presence of American attorneys. What better way to even our balance of trade than to send Japan our costliest surplus commodity?",

Where will you two live?Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replied In Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and we can both fit there nicely.Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr. Smith said with a huge grin, Okay then how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support Susie.Again, Johnny instantly replied, Our allowance... Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week. That's about 60 bucks a month, and that'll do us just fine.By this time Mr. Smith was a little shocked that Johnny had put so much thought into this. So, he thought for a moment trying to come up with something that Johnny wouldn't have an answer for.After a second, Mr. Smith said, Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?Johnny just shrugged his shoulders and said, Well, we've been lucky so far....",

Well, he spoofed, Down in Mexico they have this big building set up with a large tank of latex, and the workers are all picked according to hand size.

"Recently, I was diagnosed with A. A. A. D. D. - Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder. This is how it manifests:I decide to water my garden. As I turn on the hose in the driveway, I look over at my car and decide my car needs washing.As I start toward the garage, I notice that there is mail on the porch table that I brought up from the mail box earlier.I decide to go through the mail before I wash the car.I lay my car keys down on the table, put the junk mail in the garbage can under the table, and notice that the can is full, so I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the garbage first.But then I think, since I'm going to be near the mailbox when I take out the garbage anyway, I may as well pay the bills first.I take my check book off the table, and see that there is only 1 check left.My extra checks are in my desk in the study, so I go inside the house to my desk where I find the can of Coke that I had been drinking.I'm going to look for my checks, but first I need to push the Coke aside so that I don't accidentally knock it over. I see that the Coke is getting warm, and I decide I should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.As I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye -- they need to be watered.I set the Coke down on the counter, and I discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning.I decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.I set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly I spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table.I realize that tonight when I go to watch TV, I will be looking for the remote, but I won't remember that it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.I pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor, so I set the remote back down on the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill.Then I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.At the end of the day:The car isn't washed, the bills aren't paid, there is a warm can of Coke sitting on the counter and the flowers don't have enough water, there is still only 1 check in my check book, I can't find the remote, I can't find my glasses, and I don't remember what I did with the car keys.Then, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day long, and I'm really tired.I realize this is a serious problem, and I'll try to get some help for it, but first I'll check my e-mail.Don't laugh -- if this isn't you yet, your day is coming!!GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY.

The door of his wife's car was open, as was the front door to the house and there was no sign of the dog.Proceeding into the entry, he found an even bigger mess.

He was worried she might be ill, or that something serious had happened. He was met with a small trickle of water as it made its way out the bathroom door. As he peered inside he found wet towels, scummy soap and more toys strewn over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap and toothpaste had been smeared over the mirror and walls.As he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still curled up in the bed in her pajamas, reading a novel.

"In the future, man is exploring the universe. Due to the excessive cost, they can only send out small teams of explorers to search and investigate the millions of planets they come across. One such team lands on a barren planet that seems to be just one big rock. As they investigate, their sensors pick up life signs. They follow the sensor until they come up on a large stone sentinel  crouched down with its arms around its legs. They can detect life signs from it, but it doesn't move, doesn't appear to breathe. They call back to their commanders on Earth and report this abnormal situation. Because of this, many great scientific minds, military generals, politicians, and technical wizards are sent to try to interact with this leviathan. After many months, every walk of life has come to try to communicate with the sentinel, but nothing happens. It just sits there with its arms around its legs.Finally, one of the teamsters who sets up the stage occasionally when some big-shot dignitary comes thinking he can do better than the smartest people in the galaxy. He turns to the sentinel and in frustration yells, Will this thing EVER communicate with us?!?!?!Suddenly the sound of stone grinding against stone starts, and the great stone sentinel stands up. It scratches its chin pensively, then blurts out, No. It then crouches down again and assumes the same position it was in before.Another teamster who saw this turns to the man who yelled at the sentinel originally and says, Well, it only stands to reason.",

"Two young met while studying in seminary, Matthew Anderson and Anthony Sicola. They become great friends, but also become very competitive between each other. They both graduate 1 and 2 in their class, with Anthony being 1 and Matthew being 2. They then both go to their new parishes, which instantly become hugely popular. For years the two of them rise through the ranks of the Catholic Church, becoming bishops, arch-bishops, and cardinals around the same time. Always though, Anthony is considered the slightly better of the two. Eventually, the reigning Pope passes away, and the College of Cardinals is convened to choose the next Pope. They debate for days until the list is down to just two names, Anthony and Matthew. After another day or two of deliberation, the white smoke is seen, and they make the announcement, Matthew Anderson will be the next Pope. Anthony, happy for his friend, is perturbed because he knows in his heart that he is better and would make a better Pope. He pleads for time in front of the College of Cardinals, and is granted an audience. He asks them why they decided on Matthew and not him. For a few quiet, still minutes, not a single person talks. Then an old cardinal in the back speaks up. Anthony, we know you are the better of the two, but we ultimately had to come to a decision. That decision is that we just could not live with ourselves if we named the next Pope, Pope Sicola.Hint:Read Pope Sicola quickly if you don't get the punch line.",

"UNIX AirwaysEveryone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.Air DOSEverybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on again, and so on...Mac AirlinesAll the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up.Windows AirThe terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever.Windows NT AirJust like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.Windows XP AirYou turn up at the airport,which is under contract to only allow XP Air planes. All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket.

"FROM A FARM KID AT SAN DIEGO MARINE CORPS RECRUIT DEPOT.Dear Ma and Pa:I am well. Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile.Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled.I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late.Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water.Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc, but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon when you get fed again.It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much. We go on route marches, which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it's not my place to tell him different. A route march is about as far as to our mailbox at home.Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice but awful flat.The sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot.The Capt. is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don't bother you none.This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don't move, and it ain't shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.Then we have what they call hand-to hand combat training.You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain't like fighting with that ole bull at home. I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake. I only beat him once. He joined up the same time as me, but I'm only 5'6 and 130 pounds, and he's 6'8 and weighs near 300 pounds dry.Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.Your loving daughter,Gail.",

"Upon retirement, Dave had realized that he had poured himself into his work his entire life and never married. After spending a few weeks at home alone he decided that he needed some companionship and headed for the pet store. After looking around the store he thought that he would like to purchase a bird. He began looking at the selection available and noticed that one bird sold for $100 and the bird in the next cage was priced at $10,000. He looked and looked and studied the two birds, but he could not tell the difference, so he called over the store owner and asked him to explain. The owner said, The $10,000 bird is a perfect bird and the $100 bird is just the average everyday bird..But I still don't see the difference, said the old man. The owner explained, The $100 bird has a small hump on his beak and that made him just average. You're telling me that if that $100 dollar bird didn't have that tiny little hump in his beak he would be worth $10,000?!?!? exclaimed Dave. Well, says the owner, he might not be worth $10,000 but he would be worth quite a bit more. With much delight Dave says I'll take him! You see, I have been a master machinist my whole life and have worked with tools and my hands since I was a young boy. I think that I can file that hump off the bird's beak and make some extra money. You might be able to do that, says the owner, but I must warn you that there is a membrane in the bird's beak and if you file too deeply you will kill the bird. No problem, says Dave with great confidence, and leaves the store. About a week later Dave was back in the pet store and the owner asks how things went with the bird. He died, Dave said dejectedly. The owner says, I warned you that you could file to deeply and that would kill the bird. Oh, that's not what happened, replied Dave. Well what happened then?

The first man looks very quizzically at the dog and asks why he is allowed on the plane. The second man explains that he is a DEA agent and that the dog is a sniffing dog. His name is Sniffer, and he's the best there is. I'll show you once we get airborne, when I put him to work.Once the plane has taken off and levels out, the agent says, Watch this. He tells Sniffer to search. Sniffer jumps down, walks along the aisle, and finally sits very purposefully next to a woman for a several seconds. Sniffer then returns to its seat and puts one paw on the agent's arm. The agent says, Good boy, and turns to the man and says, That woman is in possession of marijuana, so I'm making a note of her seat number and the authorities will apprehend her when we land.Say, that's pretty neat, replies the first man.Once again, the agent sends Sniffer to search the aisles. The Lab sniffs about, sits down beside a man for a few seconds, returns to its seat, but this time, he places TWO paws on the agent's arm. The agent says, That man is carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of his seat number for the police.I like it! says his seatmate.The agent then tells Sniffer to search again. Sniffer walks up and down the aisles for a bit, sits down for a moment, and then comes racing back to the agent. He jumps into his seat and proceeds to poop all over the place. The first man is really grossed out by this behavior, and can't figure out why a well-trained dog would act like that, so he asks the agent, What's going on? The agent nervously replies, He just found a bomb!",

"Michael Jordan made over $300,000 a game. That equals $10,000 a minute, at an average of 30 minutes per game. With $40 million in endorsements, he made $178,100 a day, working or not. If he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. If he goes to see a movie, it will cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX , it would take him a whole 12 hours. He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,390 for that round. If you were given a penny for every 10 dollars he made, you'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year.

The preacher turns around and is almost overcome by the smell of alcohol, whereupon he asks the drunk, Are you ready to find Jesus? The drunken man answers, Yes, I am. So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the water. He pulls him up and asks the drunk, Brother have you found Jesus? The drunken man replies, No, I haven't found Jesus. The preacher shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again for a little longer. He again pulls him out of the water and asks again, Have you found Jesus my brother? The drunk again answers, No, I haven't found Jesus. By this time the preacher is at his wits end and dunks the drunk in the water again -- but this time holds him down for about 30 seconds and when he begins kicking his arms and legs he pulls him up. The preacher again asks the drunk, For the love of God have you found Jesus? The drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher, Are you sure this is where he fell in?",

"An elderly spinster called the lawyer's office and told the receptionist she wanted to see the lawyer about preparing a will. The receptionist suggested they set up a convenient time for the spinster to come to the office. You must understand, I've lived alone all my life, I rarely see anyone, and I don't like to go out.  Would it be possible for the lawyer to come to my house? the elderly woman asked. The receptionist checked with the attorney who agreed and went to the spinster's home to discuss her estate and the will. The lawyer's first question was, Would you please tell me what you have in assets and how you'd like them to be distributed under your will? I have $40,000 in my savings account at the bank, she replied.Tell me just how would you like the $40,000 to be distributed? the lawyer asked. Well, as I've told you, I've lived a reclusive life, people have hardly ever noticed me, so I'd like them to notice when I pass on, said the woman. I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral. Well, for $35,000 you will be able to have a funeral that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lasting impression on anyone who may not have taken much note of you! the lawyer exclaimed. I need to know, what would you like to do with the remaining $5,000?The spinster replied, As you know, I've never married and the fact is I've never slept with a man. So before I die, I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me just once. This is a very unusual request, the lawyer said, but I'll see what I can do to arrange it and get back to you.That evening, the lawyer was at home telling his wife about the eccentric spinster and her weird request. After thinking about how much she could do around the house with $5,000 and with a bit of coaxing, she got her husband to agree to provide the service himself. The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house and waited while he went in. She waited for over an hour, but her husband didn't come out, so she blew the car horn. Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck his head out and yelled, Pick me up tomorrow, she's going to let the county bury her.",

As he walked to school that day, the dollar in his hand, a little girl came up to him and said, I will give you 2 shiny quarters for that dollar. Max figured that 2 was better than 1, so he willingly traded. When Max reached the school, a little boy came up to him and said, I'll give you 3 dimes for those 2 quarters. Max traded again. Then his teacher came up to him, and knowing that he was so dumb, asked him to trade his 3 dimes for 4 nickels. Again, he traded. As Max was walking home from school that day, a old man came up to him and said, Will you trade those 4 nickels for these 5 pennies? Max traded.

This was odd because it would cost these poor inductees nearly $30.00 per month more for their higher coverage than what the government was already granting.The Captain decided that he would not ask Boudreaux about his selling techniques but that he would sit in the back of the room and observe  Boudreaux's sales pitchBoudreaux stood up before his latest group of inductees and stated, If you have da normal GI insurance and go to Iraq and get killed, the government pays your beneficiary $6,000. If you take out the supplemental GI insurance, which cost you only $30.00 a month, the government has topay your beneficiary $200,000.Now, Boudreaux concluded, which bunch do you think they gonna send to Iraq first?",

"Little Johnny Clever was in Mrs. Gleason's 3rd grade class for just a couple of weeks when he ran home to his mom and showed her a little 3x3 piece of paper.  It had the word Homework crossed out in a circle with a slash What is this? The mother said inquiringly.Its a no homework pass mommy! I raised my hand the most in class.  All you have to do is sign it and I dont have to do any homework for tonight! says Johnny excitedly!'Well thats a good thing to keep kids interested in the subject and class participation. I bet this teacher's been teaching for quite a while!' thought his mother as she signed the slip for him.     So the next day Johnny comes home again just as excited.  He won another no homework pass.  His mother was starting to be very proud.  This happened every day for the whole nine weeks.     On report card day, Johnny came home with a D and she started to wonder if maybe he shouldnt be given so many no homework passes but when she asked him about it, he said that the tests were just very hard. Well that's allright Johnny, mommy didnt do very well on tests when she was a little girl either. But thats why you have to do your homework to keep up the test grades from making you to fail.      The same thing happened all next nine weeks with the no homework pass, and Johnny's mom was sure that her little boy was going to get an A next report card.  She started bragging to all her co-workers just how well little Johnny was doing.  Johnny's dad was hearing the good work that his son was doing and was boasting to all of his co-workers as well.  At the end of the nine-weeks, they both decided to have a party and let everyone see the big improvement their son was having from bringing that C up to an A.      On the big report card day, Mom and Dad were laughing and having a good time when Little Johnny came in the front door and saw all the guests his mom and dad had.  Taken aback by this, he asked his mom what was going on.This is for you honey! for doing so well in school! Show everyone your report card!Um mom... my teacher wants you to call her first before you open the report card?Oh? she said? 'She must want to tell me what a great job Little Johnny's been doing!' she thought... so called the teacher and put her on loud speaker for everyone to hear.Ahem, Mrs. Gleason? Hi! This is Mrs. Clever! Little Johnny's mom! Im so happy you wanted to speak to me about my little boy! exclaimed Johnny's mom.Mrs. Clever? I'm not too sure what you're talking about... Did you see the report card?    Thinking this was the big moment, and she opened up the card to see the big F that Johnny came home with.  Obviously getting upset at the teacher because she knew immediately what happened... she spoke back very flustered.Mrs. Gleason! I am appalled! If johnny wasnt doing so well, why did you keep giving him the no homework passes that I was signing??N-n-no homework PASSES? a chuckling Mrs. Gleason started... no no no... They're no homework SLIPS, when the children dont do their homework! they have to get them signed and bring them back!....oh really... Mrs Clever started to eye little Johnny as he started backing away...You mean to tell me that he's been telling you they're no homework passes?..... So the next day, Johnny couldnt sit down very well...... and the next day after that, Johnny had his homework.",

"I had been dating this really cool guy for like 2 weeks, and we finally went out. We saw the RING and i was totally freaked, and I had ordered a HUGE pop, and drunk it all. Anyway, we were really snuggling tight,like our legs were wrapped around each other, and such. Of course, I had to pee bad, but I didnt want to interupt our snuggling, as it might result in, when I got back, not re-snuggling, so I didnt. At one point, there was this sudden, out of nowhere, loud noise, and it freaked me out, and, as you've probably guessed, I peed. But, it wouldnt stop. It was really bad. I was wearing a skirt and so, afer drenching my undies, it trickled down my legs, and since his legs were wrapped around mine,it trickled down his, too... When he felt it, he jumped up, saw my wet skirt, and yelled, Did u just pee all over me? which caused a HUGE disturbance as everyone turned to look at me. He goes, Well??!! so I hav to tell him yes and he yells for me to leave and to not come back. I did, actually, and I had to call for my best friend to pick me up, as I had come in my boyfriend's car.",

"A son and a father are walking together in a sunday morning, chatting. They enter a park and pass by a big, fat man, on a bench, drooling in his sleep  and a bag of potato chips on his lap. As they pass by him the son snickers, while the father sighs. They continue walking talking about many things. Eventually, a hot woman in a red dress passes by, the son looks at her with eyes of passion. The father looks at her too.Son, don't be fooled by a woman's good looksthe son looks at his father, ready for a lesson.That's your mom 20 years agothen he sighs.That's your mom now, he says as he looks at the man on the bench.",

"There once was an American Indian whose given name was OneStone. He was so named because he had only one testicle. He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him OneStone. After years and years of torment, OneStone finally cracked and said, If anyone calls me OneStone again, I will kill them! Word quickly spread and nobody called him that any more. Then one day a young woman named BlueBird forgot and said, Good morning, OneStone. He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. Then he made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. Word got around that OneStone meant what he promised he would do. Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named YellowBird returned to the village after being away for many years. YellowBird, who was BlueBird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw OneStone. She hugged him and said, Good to see you, OneStone. OneStone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, and made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, and made love to her all the next night, but YellowBird just wouldn't die!   The Moral of this story:You can't kill two Birds with OneStone.",

"DOS BeerRequires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.----------------------------------------------------------- Mac BeerAt first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by many to be a light beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you are told that you don't need to know. A notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.----------------------------------------------------------- Windows 3.1 BeerOnce considered the world's most popular beer. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac Beers. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.----------------------------------------------------------- OS/2 BeerComes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer  claims that 9 million six-packs have been sold. -----------------------------------------------------------Windows 95 BeerThe can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.----------------------------------------------------------- Windows NT BeerComes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 95 Beer. Touted as an industrial strength beer, and suggested only for use in bars.----------------------------------------------------------- Windows 98 BeerMillions sampled Windows95 beer and noticed that it was often flat, right out of the can. The manufacturer of Windows95 beer decided to re-release it as Windows98 beer and guarantee it's freshness. Most consumers are skeptical of the manufacturer's claims, and will continue to drink flat Windows95 beer because they have acquired the taste for it.----------------------------------------------------------- Windows 2000 BeerThe manufacturer of the Windows line of beers says this will be the beer, if they can just finish playing with the ingredients. This beer will have many ingredients of Windows 95/98 and NT beers. Many drinkers in the future will be forced to drink this when they get thirsty since they won't be able to find Windows 95 or 98 or NT beer on the shelves. According to manufacturer it's combines the greatest taste ever with almost no calories. Only one problem, the cans explode without warning and take out half the refrigerator with them.----------------------------------------------------------- Unix BeerComes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz. Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of instructions or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.----------------------------------------------------------- Linux BeerLINUX beer tastes just like Unix beer. Like Unix beer, Linux beer is intended for expert beer drinkers only. It originally had no pop tops or cans because you had to brew it yourself. First you would get a recipe and some yeast from a Unix guru. Then go plow a field, plant your barley and hops. After harvest you would take your Kernels and put them into a barrel full of water, then you just add your yeast close the lid, and let your beer compile. After all this you have what experts claim to be one of the Worlds Best Beers. Linux beers do not normally explode but many brewers have been known to. Linux beer is now available from some Micro Brewerys in handy pop top versions for easy drinking by beginner Unix or Linux beer drinkers. Keep your can openers handy.----------------------------------------------------------- AmigaDOS BeerThe company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.----------------------------------------------------------- VMS BeerRequires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping. However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments. When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.-----------------------------------------------------------Windows xp beerA beer that can be enjoyed at home or at the office. Like tequila however, many cans are prone to have a fat, juicy worm inside. This brew is also highly susceptible to theft. If this occurs, there is no limit to how much damage can be inflicted. If that weren't enough, u can forget about refrigerating this drink, since that won't stop the hordes of viruses it will accumulate.",

"An 80 year old man who was an avid golfer moved to a new town and joined the local country club. He went to the club for the first time to play, but was told there wasn't anybody he could play because they were already out on the course. He repeated several times that he really wanted to play. Finally, the Assistant Pro said he would play with him and asked how many strokes he wanted for a bet. The 80 year old said I really don't need any strokes as I have been playing quite well. The only real problem I have is getting out of sand traps. And he did play well. Coming to the par four - 18th they were all even. The pro had a nice drive and was able to get on the green and 2-putt for a par. The old man had a nice drive, but his approach shot landed in a sand trap next to the green. Playing from the bunker he hit a high ball which landed on the green and rolled into the hole! Birdie, match and all the money! The Pro walked over to the sand trap where his opponent was still standing in the trap. He said Nice shot, but I thought you said you have a problem getting out of sand traps? I do, replied the old man.Please give me a hand.",

"By following the instructions below, you should have error-free, long-lasting floppy disks. 1. Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders. 2. Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. When waxing the diskettes, make sure the surface is even. This will allow the diskette to spin faster, resulting in better access time. 3. Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the drive. Big diskettes may be folded and used in little disk drives. 4. Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. 5. Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the xerox machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the data will be written on both diskettes. 6. Diskettes should not be inserted or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. Occasionally the red light remains flashing in what is known as a hung or hooked state. If your system is hooking you will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed access to the slot. 7. If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for 2 minutes. This will pack the data enough  to allow for more storage. Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss data. 8. Access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk. 9. Diskettes may be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided that they are properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before using.  10. Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data is stored much too small for the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, however, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope. 11. Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs from spreading.",
"The new Librarian decided that instead of checking out children's books by writing the names of borrowers on the book cards herself, she would have the youngsters sign their own names. She would then tell them they were signing a Contract for returning the books on time. Her first customer was a second grader, who looked surprised to see a new Librarian. He brought four books to the desk and shoved them across to the Librarian, giving her his name as he did so. The Librarian pushed the books back and told him to sign them out. The boy laboriously printed his name on each book card and then handed them to her with a look of utter disgust.

"An autopsy professor was giving an introductory lecture to a class of students. Standing over a corpse, he addressed the class. There are two things you need to make a career in medical forensics.

"1. A mandatory evacuation means just that - get the hell out. Don't blame the Government after they tell you to go. If they hadn't said anything, I can see the argument.

If you didn't do this, it's not the governments fault you're starving. 2a. If you run out of food and water, find a store that has some.  2b. If the local store is too looted of food or water, leave your neighbor's tv and stereo alone.  They worked hard to get their stuff.

It's always better to be down here wishing you were up there than up there wishing you were down here. 5. The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire. 6. The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keep the pilot cool. Because when it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start sweating. 7. When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collided with the sky. 8. A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great' landing is one after which they can use the plane again. 9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make all of them yourself. 10. You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power to taxi to the ramp. 11. The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of survival and vice-versa. 12. Never let an aircraft take you somewhere your brain didn't get to five minutes earlier. 13. Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about might be another airplane going in the opposite direction. Reliable sources also report that mountains have been known to hide out in clouds. 14. Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to the number of take offs you've made. 15. There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing. Unfortunately no one knows what they are. 16. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck. 17. Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels them. 18. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going round and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger compartment, things are not at all as they should be. 19. In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum going hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour, the ground has yet to lose. 20. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, experience usually comes from bad judgment. 21. It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as much as possible. 22. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed. 23. Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And it's not subject to repeal. 24. The four most useless things to a pilot are the altitude above you, runway behind you, gas back at the airport, and a tenth of a second ago. 25. There are old pilots and there are bold pilots. There are, however, no old, bold pilots.",
"The priest was instructing a class of third- graders at All Saints grammar school. There were two brothers, and one of them chose the wicked path of Satan. The brother was evil and corrupt and did great damage to many people, and wound up a convicted criminal in a tiny, dark cell. But the other brother studied hard and became a great, rich, knowledgeable lawyer. Now, children, what is the difference between these two brothers, who started out in the same place, who together embarked upon life's stormy seas? Herman raised his hand and said, Easy. One of them got caught.",
"Dear Husband:I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for good.  I've been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show for it.  These last two weeks have been hell.  Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw.  Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new negligee.  You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game.  You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything.  Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone.P.S.  If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life!                        Your EX-WifeDear Ex-WifeNothing has made my day more than receiving your letter.  It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a far cry from what you've been.  I watch sports so much to try to drown out your constant nagging.  Too bad that doesn't work.  I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind was, You look just like a man!  My mother raised me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice.  When you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago.  I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it.  I prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me thatmorning and your negligee was $49.99.  After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out, so when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone.  Everything happens for a reason, I guess.  I hope you have the filling life you always wanted.  My lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care.P.S.  I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother, was born Carla.  I hope that's not a problem.           Signed Rich As Hell and Free!",

I would like you to remember that I asked for a pair of rollar blades, a bicycle, an electric train, and a football uniform. I destroyed my brain studying this whole year. Not only was I the first class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not going to lie to you, but there was nobody in my neighborhood who behaved better than me including to my parents, my brothers and sisters, my neighbors, and my friends. I would even help the elderly across the street and go on errands. There was virtually nothing within reach that I would not do for humanity. What ball you have leaving me a fuckin yoyo, a lame whistle, and a pair of ugly socks. What the fuck were you thinking, you fat ugly prick, that you've taken me for a sucker the whole fuckin year to come out lile this with shit under the tree. As if u hadn't fucked me enough you gave that little quiff across the street so many toys he can't even walk into his house. Don't let me see you trying to get your fat ass down the chimney next year. I'll throw rocks at the stupid reindeer and scare them away so you'll have to walk back to the North Pole, just like I had to do because you didn't get me a fuckin bike.

"A defendant was on trial for murder. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense's closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all, the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom. He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened. Finally the lawyer said, Actually, I made up the previous statement. But, you all looked on with anticipation. I therefore put to you that you have a reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty. The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty. But how? inquired the lawyer. You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door. The jury foreman replied, Oh, we all looked, but your client didn't.",

''Well, I do have a double room with one occupant, a Navy guy,'' admitted the manager, ''and he might be glad to split the cost. But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained in the past. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you.'' ''No problem,'' the tired Marine assured him. ''I'll take it.'' The next morning the Marine came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. ''How'd you sleep?'' asked the manager. ''Never better.'' The manager was impressed. ''No problem with the other guy snoring, then?'' ''Nope, I shut him up in no time,'' said the Marine. ''How'd you manage that?'' asked the manager. ''He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room,'' the Marine explained.

"A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.",

At home, you get to read weekly readers starring Dick, Jane, and Spot and worry about how to send Jr. to college and still be able to eat for the next twenty years. In prison, all your medical care is free. At home, you have to pawn your mother's silver and fill out trillions of papers for insurance and hope the doctor will see you before you die. In prison, if you have visitors, all you do is go to a room, sit, talk and then say good-bye when you are ready or your time is up. At home, you get to clean for days in advance and then cook and clean up after your guests and hope that they will one day leave. In prison, you can spend your free time writing letters or just hang out in your own space all day. At home, you get to clean your space and everyone else's space, too, and what the heck is free time again? In prison, you get your own personal toilet. At home, you have to physically hold the bathroom door shut in order to keep from having someone standing over you demanding to know how long till you're done so you can do something for them. In prison, the prison laundry takes care of all your dirty clothes. At home, you get to take care of them yourself, plus everybody else's, and get yelled at because somebody's favorite shirt isn't clean. In prison, they take you everywhere you need to go. At home, you take everybody else where they need to go. In prison, the guards transport all your personal effects for you and make sure nothing is missing. At home, you have to lug around everybody else's stuff in your purse and then wonder who went in it and took your last dollar. In prison, there are no screaming or whining children or spouses asking you to do something else for them, or screaming at you because you didn't. At home....stop me when I get to the downside of jail, will ya?",
"Once upon a time, there was a tribe of very hostile Indians who, upon catching a person on their land, would cut the person up and make a canoe out of them.  One day, three men were walking through the woods when they wandered upon the canoe-making Indian's land.  They were all caught and given one death wish.  The man from Italy said, I would like one last slice of pizza before I die.  So he ate his pizza and was cut up and made into a canoe.  The man from America said, I would like one last hamburger before I die.  So he ate his hamburger and was cut up and made a canoe.  The last man asked for a fork.  What the hell - a fork??!!!  Why the hell do you want a fuckin fork???  But they got him a fork, anyways.  The man took the fork and began stabbing himself with it, saying, YER NOT MAKIN A CANOE OUT OF ME!!!",

"There was once a man from the city who was visiting a small farm, and during this visit he saw a farmer feeding pigs in a most extraordinary manner. The farmer would lift a pig up to a nearby apple tree, and the pig would eat the apples off the tree directly. The farmer would move the pig from one apple to another until the pig was satisfied, then he would start again with another pig. The city man watched this activity for some time with great astonishment. Finally, he could not resist saying to the farmer, This is the most inefficient method of feeding pigs that I can imagine. Just think of the time that would be saved if you simply shook the apples off the tree and let the pigs eat them from the ground! The farmer looked puzzled and replied, What's time to a pig?",

"University scientists have released the results of a recent analysis that reveals the presence of female hormones in beer. Men should take a concerned look at their beer consumption. It turns out that the hops in beer contain certain phyto-estrogens, and scientists believe that be drinking enough beer, men may turn into women. In the study, 100 male volunteers were asked to drink 8 pints of beer in one hour. The results were observed and recorded. At the end of one hour, every single subject had developed female characteristics and the test was terminated. The data is provided below:After one hour, 100% of the test subjects:1. gained weight.2. talked excessively without making sense.3. became overly emotional.4. couldn't drive.5. failed to think rationally.6. argued over nothing.7. had to sit down while urinating.8. refused to apologize when obviously wrong.After these eight symptoms, no further testing was necessary.",

"The recent hurricane and gasoline issues helped prove existence of a new element. In early October  a major research institution announced discovery of the heaviest element yet known to science. The new element has been named Government. Governmentium  has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton like particles called peons. Since Gv has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of Gv causes one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally take less than a second! Gv has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Gv is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. When catalyzed with money, Gv becomes Administratium  - an element which radiates just as much energy as Gv since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.",

The e-mails were stacked by the inbox with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The newbies were nestled all snug by their screens, While visions of Java danced in their dreams. My wife on the sofa and me with a snack, We just settled down at my rig . When out in the Web there arose such a clatter, I jumped to the site to see what was the matter. To a new page my Mac flew like a flash, Then made a slight gurgle. It started to crash! I gasped at the thought and started to grouse, Then turned my head sideways and clicked on my mouse.When what to my wondering eyes should appear, My Mac jumped to a page that wasn't quite clear. When the image resolved, so bright and so quick,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick! More rapid than mainframes, more graphics they came, Then Nick glanced toward my screen, my Mac called them by name; Now Compaq! Now Acer! my speaker did reel; On Apple! On Gateway! Santa started to squeal!Jump onto the circuits! And into the chip! Now speed it up! Speed it up! Make this thing hip! The screen gave a flicker, he was into my Ram, Then into my room rose a full hologram! He was dressed in all red, from his head to his shoes, Which were black . He pulled out some discs he had stored in his backpack.Santa looked like a dude who was rarin' to hack! His eyes, how they twinkled! His glasses, how techno! This ain't the same Santa that I used to know! With a wink of his eye and a nod of his head, Santa soon let me know I had nothing to dread. He spoke not a word, gave my Mac a quick poke, And accessed my C drive with only a stroke. He defragged my hard drive, and added a Dimm, Then threw in some cool games, just on a whim! He worked without noise, his fingers they flew! He distorted some pictures with Kai's Power Goo! He updated Office, Excel and Quicken, Then added a screensaver with a red clucking chicken! My eyes widened a bit, my mouth stood agape, As he added the latest version of Netscape. The drive gave a whirl, as if it were pleased, St. Nick coyly smiled, the computer appeased. Then placing his finger on the bridge of his nose, Santa turned into nothing but ones and zeros! He flew back into my screen and through my uplink, Back into the net with barely a blink. But I heard his sweet voice as he flew from my sight, Happy surfing to all, and to all a good byte!",

"It was the senior citizens' monthly bus trip, and the new driver, a great deal younger than their usual driver, a sedate 50-something, was careering down winding roads at quite a pace.The volunteer who was accompanying them was a little flustered, and with an embarrassed laugh, said to the old lady across the aisle, Some speed, eh, Mrs. Jones?I don't know about the others, she replied, but I certainly have!",

The engineers rolled on the floor.Mouse BallsMouse balls are now available as FRU .Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced by the twist-off method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse can be used immediately.It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.Any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.",

"There once was a college professor who didn't buy into the whole there's no such thing as a stupid question philosophy. Every year when he had a new class he instructed the students to ask him as many stupid questions as they could think of on the first day. That way, he figured, there'd be a minimized amount of stupidity for the duration of the term.The professor thought he'd heard every stupid question there was and didn't laugh no matter what his students asked him, not even a smirk. Then, finally, a student asked something that he'd never heard before. The question made him laugh so hard he couldn't stand up. A lanky, tomboyish girl raised her hand with a wry smile on her face, stood up and asked, What is a question?",

"This is how Army policy all begins... Start with a cage containing five apes. In the cage, hang a banana on a string and put stairs under it. Before long, an ape will go to the stairs and start to climb towards the banana. As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the apes with cold water. After a while, another ape makes an attempt with the same result - all the apes are sprayed with cold water. Continue, until when another ape tries to climb the stairs, the other apes try to prevent it. Now, turn off the cold water. Now, remove one ape from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new ape sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other apes attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted. Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm. Again, replace a third original ape with a new one. The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of the four apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest ape. After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes which have been sprayed with cold water have been replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever again approaches the stairs. Why not? Because that's the way it's always been around here. That's how Army policy begins...",

"Jake is struggling through a bus station with two huge and obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and asks Have you got the time? Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist. It's a quarter to six, he says. Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch! exclaims the stranger. Jake brightens a little. Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out. - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropoli. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says The time is eleven 'til six in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. Jake continues I've put in regional accents for each city. The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. That's not all, says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning, explains Jake. View recede ten, Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. I want to buy this watch! says the stranger. Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet. I'm still working out the bugs. says the inventor. Look at this, and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far. finishes Jake. I've got to have this watch! says the stranger. No, you don't understand - it's not ready. I'll give you $1000 for it! Oh, no, I've already spent more than - I'll give you $5000 for it! But it's just not - I'll give you $15,000 for it! And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it. Jake abruptly makes his decision. OK, he says, and peels off the watch. They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. Hey, wait a minute, calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station. Don't forget your batteries.",
"The Pentagon recently found it had too many generals and offered an early retirement bonus. They promised any general who retired right away, his full annual benefits PLUS $10,000 for every inch measured in a straight line along the retiring general's body between two points he chose. The first general accepted. He asked the pension man to measure from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. 6 feet. He walked out with a check for $720,000. The second general asked them to measure from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. 8 feet. He walked out with a check for $960,000. Meantime, the first general had tipped off the third. When he was asked where to measure, he told the pension man, From the tip of my penis to my testicles. The pension man said that would be fine, but he'd better get the Medical Officer to do the measuring. The Medical Officer attended and asked the general to drop 'em... he did... The Medical Officer placed the tape on the tip of the general's penis and began to work back. My God! he said, where are your testicles? The general replied, Back in Vietnam!",
"Morris, as a young man in the Old West, wanted to be the best gunfighter alive. One night as he was sitting in a saloon, he spotted an old man who had the reputation of being the greatest gunfighter in his day. So Morris walked up to the old man and told him his dream. The old man looked him up and down and said, I have a suggestion that is sure to help. Tell me, tell me, said the young man. Tie the bottom of your holster lower onto your leg. Will that make me a better gunfighter? Definitely, said the old man. Young Morris did what he was told and drew his gun and shot the bow tie off the piano player. Wow, that really helped. Do you have any more suggestions? Yeah, if you cut a notch in the top of your holster where the hammer hits, the gun will come out smoother. Will that make me a better gunfighter? It sure will, said the old man. The young guy did what he was told and drew his gun and shot a cufflink off the piano player. This is really helping me. Is there anything else you can share with me? One more thing, said the old man. Get that can of axle grease over there in the corner and rub it all over your gun. The young Morris didn't hesitate but started putting the grease on the gun. No, the whole gun, handle and everything, said the old man. Will that make me a better gunfighter? No, said the old man, but, when Wyatt Earp gets done playing that piano, he's going to put that gun where the sun don't shine, and it won't hurt as much.",

I m not winning as much as I used to but I'm still making a bit of money. I had some problems with my swing, but I think I've got that worked out now.

Stevie says, Yes, I've been playing for years. But I thought you're blind! How can you play golf if you are blind? Jack asks. I get my caddie to stand in the middle of the fairway and call to me. I listen for the sound of his voice and play the ball towards him, then when I get to where the ball lands the caddie moves to the green or further down the fairway and again I play the ball towards his voice, explains Stevie. But how do you putt? Nicklaus wondered. Well, says Stevie, I get my caddie to lean down in front of the hole and call to me with his head on the ground and I just play the ball to the sound of his voice. Nicklaus says, What is your handicap? I play off scratch, Stevie assures Jack. Nicklaus is incredulous and says to Stevie, We must play a game sometime.

"Every night, after dinner, a man took off for the local tavern. He spent the whole evening there, and arrived home very drunk around midnight each night. He always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine. One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened to her, and then said, Why don't you treat him a little differently, when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways. The wife thought that might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door, and quickly went to it, and opened the door, and let Harry in. This time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed, now, don't you think? At that, Harry replied, in his inebriated state, I guess we might as well. I'll be getting in trouble with the stupid wife when I get home anyway!",

"Top Ten Reasons Eve Was Created10. God was worried that Adam would frequently become lost in the garden because he would not ask for directions.9. God knew that one day Adam would require someone to locate and hand him the remote.8. God knew Adam would never go out and buy himself a new fig leaf when his wore out and would therefore need Eve to buy one for him.7. God knew Adam would never be able to make a doctor's, dentist, or haircut appointment for himself.6. God knew Adam would never remember which night to put the garbage on the curb.5. God knew if the world was to be populated, men would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing.4. As the Keeper of the Garden, Adam would never remember where he left his tools.3. Apparently, Adam needed someone to blame his troubles on when God caught him hiding in the garden.2.

"A lone tourist who is passing through the suburbs on the way to town by car, unfortunately experiences mechanical problems with the automobile. The car stalls and the tourist parks the car by the side of the road and waits for help. Not much later, a farmer happens to pass by with a truck full of farm animals. The farmer offers the tourist a lift to town and proceeds to explain that he is bringing his farm animals to the town market, where they will be auctioned off to the highest bidders. Well, it so happens that on the way to the town, the farmer being so engrossed in his story, unintentionally wanders into the other side of road where another vehicle is approaching in the other direction. The farmer realizes his absent mindness and attempts to avoid the possible collision with the other vehicle. He just misses the other car, but unfortunately crashes the truck into the side of the road. The tourist winds up thrown into a ditch and suffers broken ribs and a broken arm and leg and is obviously in extreme pain. The farm animals are all messed up very badly and the farmer, although remaining inside the vehicle, still suffers cuts and scrapes. The farmer gets out of the truck and looks at his farm animals. The chickens all have broken limbs and can barely move. These chickens are all useless! Nobody will want to buy these chickens anymore! bellows the farmer. With that, he grabs and loads his shotgun and blows away the chickens. Next, he sees the pigs and they are all lame and bleeding profusely. These pigs are all worthless now! I'll get nothing for them! yells the farmer. With great rage, the farmer reloads his shotgun and blows away the pigs. The farmer looks at the sheep and they all have broken limbs and their wool is all bloodied. Worthless sheep! screams the farmer and with that, he reloads his shotgun and blows away the sheep. Meanwhile, the injured tourist witnesses all of this carnage in great horror. The farmer then moves over to the side of the ditch and looks at the tourist. Are you okay down there? asked the farmer. NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! the tourist yelled back.",

"A champion jockey is about to enter an important race on a new horse.

The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, It's no good, I'll have to do it, and yells, ALLLEEE OOOP! really loudly.

This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong.

"Three guys, who had all died around the same time at about the same place, were waiting to take their place in Heaven. They were told by the angel that there was room for only one of them in Heaven. Their fate would be determined by the way each of them had died, so the angel went to each man and asked how they had died.The first guy, when approached, said:Well, I live on the 14th floor of my apartment building and I came home early from work because I suspected that my wife had been cheating on me, and I wanted to give the other man a piece of my mind. However, when I got home there was no one in the apartment aside from my wife, but my intuition told me otherwise, so I searched the apartment. When I came to my balcony, ready the commit suicide, I saw a man hanging on, at that point I was so angry at him that I stepped on his hands hoping he'd fall off, but he remained firm. So I went back inside and got a hammer and hit his hands, but he still didn't fall off. In my frustration I went in the kitchen and got the refrigerator, flinging myself, the refrigerator, and him down 14 floors. And that is how I died.The second guy said:I am a window washer and was cleaning the windows on the 17 story when my cart broke and I began falling. Luckily I was able to grab onto the 14th story balcony, when this guy comes. I was so relieved thinking I'd be rescued, when instead, he starts stepping on my hands, but I refused to fall and die so I put all my energy into staying on. Then the guy goes back inside and comes back with a hammer and starts hitting my hands again, but I refused to let go. Finally the guy goes back inside and flings himself and refrigerator on me. And that is how I died.The third guy said:Well, I was in this lady's aparment and we were making out on the couch, and things were heating up until her husband comes home early. I quickly hid in the refrigerator, and that's all I remember.Who do you think went to Heaven?",

"A man who had been in a mental home for some years finally seemed to have improved to the point where it was thought he might be released.The head of the institution, in a fit of commendable caution, decided, however, to interview him first.Tell me, said he, if we release you, as we are considering doing, what do you intend to do with your life?The inmate said, It would be wonderful to get back to real life, and if I do, I will certainly refrain from making my former mistake. I was a nuclear physicist, you know, and it was the stress of my work in weapons research that helped put me here. If I am released I shall confine myself to work in pure theory; where I trust the situation will be less difficult and stressful.Marvelous, said the head of the institution.Or else, ruminated the inmate, I might teach. There is something to be said for spending one's life in bringing up a new generation of scientists.Absolutely, said the head.Then again, I might write. There is considerable need for books on science for the general public. Or I might even write a novel based on my experiences in this fine institution.An interesting possibility, said the head.And finally, if none of these things appeals to me, I can always continue to be a teakettle.",

"With all the new technology regarding fertility, an 88-year-old woman was able to give birth to a baby recently. When she was discharged from the hospital and went home, various relatives came to visit. May we see the new baby? one of them asked. Not yet, said the mother. I'll make coffee and we can visit for a while first. Another half hour passed before another relative asked, May we see the new baby now? No, not yet, said the mother. A while later and again the guests asked, May we see the baby now? No, not yet, replied the mother. Growing impatient, they asked, Well, when can we see the baby? When she cries! she told them. When she cries? they gasped. Why do we have to wait until she cries? Because, I forgot where I put her.",

"Here is a collection of freshman history bloopers collected by a Canadian history professor  over the years.After the refirmation were wars both foreign and infernal. If the Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold throughout northern Europe which would include their posetions in Italy, Burgundy, central Europe and India thus serrounding France. The German Emperor's lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years.Louise XIV became King of the Sun. He gave the people food and artillery. If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row for the rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation. In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great. Peter filled his goverment with accidental people and built a new capital near the European boarder. Orthodox priests became government antennae.The enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare wrote a book called Candy that got him into trouble with Frederick the Great. Philosophers were unknown as yet, and the fundamental stake was one of religious toleration slightly confused with defeatism. France was in a serious state. Taxation was a great drain on the state budget. The French revolution was accomplished before it happened. The revolution evolved through republican and tolarian phases until it catapulted into Napolean. Napoleon was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.History, a record of things left behind by past generations, started in 1815. Throughout the comparatively radical years 1815-1870 the western European continent was undergoing a Rampant period of economic modification. Industrialisation was precipitating in England.Problems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a city population of 1 million people, 2 million able bodies were on the loose.Great Brittian, the USA and other European countries had demicratic leanings. The middle class was tired and needed a rest. The old order could see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake. Among the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and anal parliment. Voting was to be done by ballad.",
"Here is a collection of freshman history bloopers collected by a Canadian history professor  over the years.During the Middle Ages, everybody was middle aged. Church and state were cooperatic. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords and surfs. It is unfortunate that we do not have a medivel European laid out on a table before us, ready for dissection.After a revival of infantile commerce slowly creeoed into Europe, merchants appeared. Some were sitters and some were drifters. They roamed from town to town exposing themselves and organized big fairies in the countryside.Mideval people were violent. Murder during this Period was nothing. Everybody killed someone. England fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and losing. The Crusades were a series of military expaditions made by Christians seeking to free the holy land  from the Islams.In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular. A class of yeowls arose. Finally Europe caught the Black Death. The bubonic plague is a social disease in the sense that it can be transmitted by intercourse and other etceteras. It was spread from port to port by infected rats. Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. The plague also helped the emergance of the English language as the national language of England, France and Italy.The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renasence bolted in from the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more individuals felt the value of their human being. Italy, of course, was much closer to the rest of the world thanks to Northern Europe. Man was determined to civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had to roll! It became sheik to be educated. Art was on a more associated level. Europe was full of incredable churches with great art bulging out of their doors. Renaissance merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike.The Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope, thus enriching Catholic coiffures. Traditions had become oppressive so they too were crushed in the wake of man's quest for ressurection above the not-just-social beast he had become. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation. Calvinism was the most convenient religion since the days of the ancients. Anabaptist services tended to be migratory. The Popes, of course, were usually Catholic. Monks went right on seeing themselves as worms. The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.",

"Phone won't stop ringing? Here's what you do -Leola Starling of Ribrock, Tenn., had a serious telephone problem, but unlike most people she did something about it. The brand-new $10 million Ribrock Plaza Motel opened nearby and had acquired almost the same telephone number as Leola. From the moment the motel opened, Leola was besieged by calls not for her. Since she had the same phone number for years, she felt that she had a case to persuade the motel management to change its number. Naturally, the management refused claiming that it could not change its stationery. The phone company was not helpful, either. A number was a number, and just because a customer was getting someone else's calls 24 hours a day didn't make it responsible. After her pleas fell on deaf ears, Leola decided to take matters into her own hands. At 9 o'clock the phone rang. Someone from Memphis was calling the motel and asked for a room for the following Tuesday. Leola said, No problem. How many nights? A few hours later Dallas checked in. A secretary wanted a suite with two bedrooms for a week. Emboldened, Leola said the Presidential Suite on the 10th floor was available for $600 a night. The secretary said that she would take it and asked if the hotel wanted a deposit. No, that won't be necessary, Leola said. We trust you. The next day was a busy one for Leola. In the morning, she booked an electric appliance manufacturers' convention for Memorial Day weekend, a college prom and a reunion of the 82nd Airborne veterans from World War II. She turned on her answering machine during lunchtime so that she could watch her favorite soap opera, but her biggest challenge came in the afternoon when a mother called to book the ballroom for her daughter's wedding in June. Leola assured the woman that it would be no problem and asked if she would be providing the flowers or did she want the hotel to take care of it. The mother said that she would prefer the hotel to handle the floral arrangements. Then the question of valet parking came up. Once again Leola was helpful. There's no charge for valet parking, but we always recommend that the client tips the drivers. Within a few months, the Ribrock Plaza Motel was a disaster area. People kept showing up for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and Sweet Sixteen parties and were all told there were no such events. Leola had her final revenge when she read in the local paper that the motel might go bankrupt. Her phone rang, and an executive from Marriott said, We're prepared to offer you $200,000 for the motel. Leola replied, We'll take it, but only if you change the telephone number.",

Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant and cough it up on the carpeting.DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favourite chair...must try this on their bed .DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was...Hmmm. Not working according to plan...DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called shampoo. What sick minds could invent such a liquid? My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth and the tiny bit of flesh under my claws.DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call beer. More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of allergies. Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies, and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue  and  speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured.

The officer said, Sorry, sir, but I have to write you a ticket, and glanced at his police partner in his police car. Then the Vice President said, Ok, let me just unlock the car and I'll be on my way. Then when he clicked the trunk opener by accident, the trunk popped, and there was his best friend dead in the trunk and he said, Oops ...This shows how stupid some politicans can be.",

"A man is strolling past the mental hospital and suddenly remembers an important meeting.Unfortunately, his watch has stopped, and he cannot tell if he is late or not. Then, he notices a patient similarly strolling about within the hospital fence.Calling out to the patient, the man says, Pardon me, sir, but do you have the time?The patient calls back, One moment! and throws himself upon the ground, pulling out a short stick as he does. He pushes the stick into the ground, and, pulling out a carpenter's level, assures himself that the stick is vertical.With a compass, the patient locates north, and with a steel ruler, measures the precise length of the shadow cast by the stick.Withdrawing a slide ruler from his pocket, the patient calculates stuff rapidly, then swiftly packs up all his tools and turns back to the pedestrian saying, It is now precisely 3:29 pm, provided today is August 16th, which I believe it is.The man can't help but be impressed by this demonstration, and sets his watch accordingly.Before he leaves, he says to the patient, That was really quite remarkable, but tell me, what do you do on a cloudy day, or at night, when the stick casts no shadow? The patient holds up his wrist and says, I suppose I'd just look at my watch.",

"Elderly Man Sued for Stopping at Stop SignSeptember 9, 2002 - Atlanta, USAIn a case possibly first of its kind, 67 year old Arthur Thompson is being sued by 32 year old Lynn Manaouski for stopping at a 4-way stop sign. In her statement she described how she came up to the intersection leading into her downtown condo, and rear ended the driver in front of her due to his 'complete and full stop'. She continues to say that of the almost 2 years of living in that particular condominium complex, she had not once been behind someone who had made a full stop at the stop sign, and that his inability to be 'consistent with typical driving patterns' caused the accident. As a result, she is convinced that Mr. Thompson is directly responsible for the accident and should be held accountable for all incurred costs of repair to both vehicles. When reminded that it is the law to make a complete stop at a stop sign, her abrupt response was I am quite capable of deciding when it is a good or bad time to stop my vehicle.Owner of Perfect House Lives in CarSeptember 18, 2002 - Baltimore, USAIn fear of possibly disturbing the perfection that is his house, Donald Manison has been forced to live in his 1998 Dodge Caravan.

In order to find actors similarly dense and ignorant to the ones featured in the first batch of commercials, Apple will be holding a Lack of Talent contest. Campaign producer Ted Zielchman commented, All of the actors we were getting from the talent agencies were too intelligent, and these are people who are usually rejected based on lack of intelligence, so we are faced with a unique problem. I believe though, based on the applicants for the contest so far, we have some likely candidates. Some were unable to even spell their name and had that 'not so bright look on their face' - consistent with the first batch of actors we used. The first batch were easy to find, we visited the local district Mac Club. After that we simply had a hard time finding anyone willing to admit being an Apple user.",

"Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road? . . .DR. PHIL:The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on THIS side of the road before it goes after the problem on the OTHER SIDE of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he's acting by not taking on his CURRENT problems before adding NEW problems.OPRAH:Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.GEORGE W. BUSH:We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. Wejust want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.DONALD RUMSFELD:Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.ANDERSON COOPER/CNN:We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.JOHN KERRY:Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am for it now, and will remain against it.JUDGE JUDY:That chicken crossed the road because he's GUILTY! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.PAT BUCHANAN:To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.MARTHA STEWART:No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level.DR SEUSS:Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad?Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.ERNEST HEMINGWAY:To die in the rain. Alone.JERRY FALWELL:Because the chicken was gay! Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the other side.That's why they call it the other side. Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media white washes with seemingly harmless phrases like the other side. That chicken should not be free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that!GRANDPA:In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.BARBARA WALTERS:Isn't that interesting?

The preacher finally finished and came down to ask the cowboy how he had liked the sermon. The cowboy answered slowly, Well, I'm not too smart, but if I went to feed my cattle and only one showed up, I sure wouldn't feed him all the hay.",
"A pious man, who had reached the age of 105, suddenly stopped going to synagogue. Alarmed by the old fellow's absence after so many years of faithful attendance, the rabbi went to see him. He found him in excellent health, so the rabbi asked; How come after all these years we don't see you at services any more?The old man lowered his voice. I'll tell you, Rabbi, he whispered. When I got to be 90, I expected God to take me any day. But then I got to be 95, then 100, then 105, so I figured that God is very busy and must've forgotten about me, and I don't want to remind Him!",

"Once upon a time, long, long ago there were two unique lions in the jungles of Africa. Both, it seems, had human-like qualities that allowed them to claim territory, daring the other to cross over the line. Strange as it seems, the boundary between their turf became a well traveled trail through the jungle. All day, every day, both lions lay in the brush staring across the trail at their compatriot, daring him to cross into their territory. The local natives knew of this animal feud, but all this was unbeknown to African Jack, a well-known and very publicized guide who did not speak Lionese and was unfamiliar with the territory. While he was leading a safari through the jungle, the travelers had to walk and cut vines with their machetes, and all this constant hacking brush had them worn to a frazzle. After seeing two or three of his safari drop from exhaustion, African Jack decided to stop on the trail between these two lions and camp for the night. After setting up camp, eating, and getting his safari settled African Jack sat on a stump and began reading. While he was busily engaged in the printed page, the two lions, simultaneously, pounced on African Jack and ate him on the spot. When the 6 o'clock news heard of the tragedy, they reported, African Jack killed this evening. The motive is unclear, but it is reported he was reading between the lions.",

Well, firstly, I'd like it to have plenty of floors. Say, 5 or 6, Noah said. Ok... 5 or 6 floors I'd also like some spaces on the floors as well, to keep things in.Right, spaces. And with this God starts drawing a few designs for Noah. Would you like some animals in there to start you off? God asked him. Erm... Fish! Noah replied. Fish. Ok. What sort? Any in particular?Carp, and plenty of them, Noah said. Carp. Anything else needed? God asked. And they went through various items such as the colour, doors, windows, etc. Finally, between them both they'd come up with a design that they both agreed on. Sitting back in his chair admiring the new 'ark', God asked Noah, So, what are you going to call it? Have you thought of anything? Well God. I thought I'd call it 'Noah's Multi-Story Carp Ark'",

A nurse was on duty in the Emergency Room, when a young woman with purple hair styled into a punk rocker Mohawk, sporting a variety of tattoos, and wearing strange clothing, entered. It was quickly determined that the patient had acute appendicitis, so she was scheduled for immediate surgery. When she was completely disrobed on the operating table, the staff noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green, and above it there was a tattoo that read, Keep off the grass.Once the surgery was completed, the surgeon wrote a short note on the patient's dressing, which said, Sorry, had to mow the lawn.Submitted by RN no name3.

"A poor homeless man had 3 bananas; he had stolen one from a first grader, one from a fruit vendor, and the other was given to him by a humble old lady.Along with the banana, the humble old lady gave him bus fare, partly because she wanted him to leave, and partly because she felt sorry for him.The man jumped at the thought - he was going on a bus ride, something he hadn't done in a long time. He put one banana on either side of his torn and tatty pants, and the other banana in the back of his pants.He waited at the bus station, and waited, and waited, until finally a bus came, and he climbed on.It was one of those crowded buses, one with not much room to even sneeze.The bus driver collected the money, and the homeless man found a cramped place to stand.Everything was going smoothly until the bus made a sharp turn to the left, the banana on the left side got squished. The bus made another sharp turn, one to the right, and you can guess what happened to the banana on the right. It got squished as well.The homeless man was not going to lose the last piece of food that he had, so he grabbed the banana in the back.The bus turned to the right, to the left, and the man didn't let go. The bus went up a hill, and then down, the man still didn't release the banana from his grip. The bus went over a rocky dirt path, jumping up and down due to the rocky road, the man held tighter.They were back on smooth road, and the homeless man got tapped on the shoulder.

"Two older women were picking up a third friend for their weekly lunch when they accidentally ran over and killed her cat. It wasn't a pretty sight, so rather than leave it for the woman's husband to find, they scooped it into a Foley's bag and took it with them, intending to throw it away in the restaurant's dumpster.Upon their arrival, they discovered that the dumpster was locked. Not wanting to leave the bag in the car, they put in on the ground next to the car and went inside to eat. From their window table they could clearly see the car and bag, and so noticed immediately when a woman walked by the closed bag, looked at it with interest, and went on. In a few minutes she returned, looked a little more closely, glanced around to see if she were being watched, and strolled on. On her third pass, she casually picked up the bag without pausing, and continued on - into the restaurant! She let herself be seated, placed the bag and her purse on the floor next to her chair, and picked up the menu. She ordered, and again casually picked up the Foley's bag to see what wonderful little item she had managed to snag. She opened the bag, looked inside, shuddered, and passed out onto the floor. Instantly, restaurant staff came to her aid, dialed 911, and cared for her until the paramedics came and loaded her onto a stretcher to take her to the hospital. The last thing our three ladies saw was a paramedic as he picked up the woman's purse and the Foley's bag and placed both on her stomach as they wheeled her away.",

"Q. Do I have to be married to have safe fax?A. Although married people fax often, there are many single people who fax complete strangers every day.Q. How do I go about faxing a complete stranger?A. Just ask them if they want to fax. If they do, they will give you their phone number.Q. My parents say they never had fax when they were young, and were only allowed to write memo's to each other until they were 21. How old do you think someone should be before they can fax?A. Faxing can be performed at any age once you learn the correct procedure.Q. If I fax something to myself will I go blind?A. Certainly not. As far as we can see.Q. There is a place on our street where you can go and pay to fax. Is this legal?A. Yes, many people have no other outlet for their fax drives and must pay a professional when their needs become too great.Q. Should a cover always be used for faxing?A. Unless you are really sure of the one you are faxing, a cover should always be used.Q. What happens if I do the procedure incorrectly and fax prematurely?A. Don't panic. Many people fax prematurely when they haven't faxed in a long time. Just start over, most people won't mind if you try again.Q. I have a personal and a business fax. Can transmissions become mixed up?A. Being bi-faxual can be confusing, but so long as you use a cover with each one you won't transmit anything you're not supposed to.Q. Is getting faxed by one person the same as with another?A. No. Even though many people  would like you to believe that the longer they are faxing you the better you will like it. In reality the best fax is short, of high quality, and very graphic.Q. There is a man I'd very much like to fax  but he can't seem to keep his equipment up long enough. Is there any thing I can do to help him?A. You could suggest that he contact a good fax therapist, such as Canon or Mitsubishi. If he refuses to take the suggestion, it would be best if you just wrote him off.",

"The US Standard railroad gauge  is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did they use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their Legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.",

Oh, forgive me, said Noah. I did my best, but so many things happened. The blueprints you gave me didn't meet the city's code and I had to change them. Then the city said I was violating the zoning ordinance by building an ark in my front yard, so I had to get a varience..

"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.Quickly, God was faced with a class action suit for failure to file an environmental impact statement. God was granted a temporary permit for the project, but was stymied with the cease and desist order for the earthly part. Then God said, Let there be light! Immediately, the officials demanded to know how the light would be made. Would there be strip mining? What about thermal pollution? God explained that the light would come from a large ball of fire. God was granted provisional permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from the ball of fire, and that he would obtain a building permit and to conserve energy, He would have the light out half the time. God agreed, and offered to call the light Day and the darkness Night. The officials replied that they were not interested in semantics. God said, Let the earth put forth vegetation, plant yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit. The EPA agreed, so long as only native seed was used. Then God said, Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth. The officials pointed out that this would require approval from the Department of Game, coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audobon Society.Everything was okay until God said the project would be completed in six days. The officials said it would take at least two hundred days to review the applications and the impact statement. After that there would be a public hearing. Then there would be ten to twelve months before...At this point God created Hell.",

"Once, a barber found two MIT students wanting to buy his barber pole. They offered a good price for it, so the barber sold it to them. So - these two guys drove around all day in a pickup truck carrying the barber pole. They kept getting stopped by the police, who were sure they had stolen the pole.

"Tips for calling a business that has an answering service.  When you get the answering service, please remember these vital tips.1) When you call a lockout company, make sure you give the operator the telephone number on your account.  It's considered proper procedure for the locksmith to drive to the office to look up an alternate number where you'll be at, and then drive to you. I believe it's quicker that way too.2) After giving your last name to the operator on the line, and they ask for your first, It's ok to just say Mr or Mrs. Your voice can be deceiving as some people just may not have hit puberty by age 45. 3) If you're calling your apartment complex because your toilet is overflowing and you cant shut the water off, please go and get some coffee.  The maintenance people dont need you at home to get inside. that's what they make credit cards for.4) If it's July, and your a/c hasnt worked for 2 months, please call at 2am. Our service reps are just switching shifts and the new shift will be nice and rested to drive to the edge of the boondocks for you.5) If you just happen to be a nurse, and you're calling for a doctor that's new to the hospital, dont worry about what extention ICU is. He's a doctor and he's memorized all of the hospital's codes for every city before he graduates medschool. He remembers best when its 2 am.6) No, sir, i'm sorry. A/C technicians don't make house calls. Please bring your outside Heating and Air Conditioning unit into the shop to get repaired.And the final tip is...If you're a patient and you're calling your doctor afterhours because the medication he's prescribed for you isnt working properly, please let the operator on the line know your whole medical history. The more they know, the better they can help you! ",

"There was once a very very stupid farmer in Texas. The farmer decided he wanted to raise chickens, so he bought a standard gross of chicks.He planted the chicks in the field, watered them regularly, but nothing happened. He was a persistent type, though, so he bought another gross of chicks and planted them and cared for them - still nothing.Finally he decided he needed professional help, so he wrote a letter to the Texas A  M extension service, explaining exactly what he'd done in detail and asking for their advice. About two weeks later he received a letter from A  M, and read it:Mr. X, we are unable to diagnose your problem without further information.Please send a soil sample.",

"A family had lived in Brooklyn for three years, and their eight-year-old son had attended a Brooklyn public school for the past two years. The people of Brooklyn are renowned for their unusual, if not unique, manner of speaking, and the two years of school had given the young fellow an accent that would be recognizable anywhere in the English-speaking world.The parents were concerned about this, for they were from Virginia, and did not think it proper that their son should speak in such a manner...excuse me, mannah.They were well-to-do, so they imported a nanny from their home state, with instructions to Get The Brooklyn Out Of That Boy's Mouth.Saturday morning, the nanny took the lad for the first of many walks in a nearby park. Hearing a bird making a large ruckus high in a tree, the boy said to the nanny, Listen to that boid!Taking her instructions seriously, the nanny admonished him, That's not boid, it's bird.Puzzled, the boy replied It choips like a boid.",

"In Speech, Bush Calls Iraq, Iran, and North Korea 'Axis of Evil-N.Y. Times, 1/30/02ANGERED BY SNUBBING, LIBYA, CHINA, and SYRIA FORM AXIS OF JUST AS EVIL; Cuba, Sudan, Serbia Form Axis of Somewhat Evil; Other Nations Start Own Clubs Beijing. - Bitter after being snubbed for membership in the Axis of Evil, Libya, China, and Syria today announced they had formed the Axis of Just as Evil, which they said would be way eviler than that stupid Iran-Iraq-North Korea axis President Bush warned of in his State of the Union address. Axis of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new axis as having, for starters, a really dumb name. Right. They are Just as Evil...in their dreams! declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Everybody knows we're the best evils... best at being evil... we're the best. Diplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded, although they conceded they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil. They told us it was full, said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. An Axis can't have more than three countries, explained Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. This is not my rule, it's tradition. In World War II you had Germany, Italy, and Japan in the evil Axis. So you can only have three. And a secret handshake. Ours is wicked cool. THE AXIS PANDEMIC International reaction to Bush's Axis of Evil declaration was swift, as within minutes, France surrendered. Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed to gain triumvirate status in what became a game of geopolitical chairs. Cuba, Sudan, and Serbia said they had formed the Axis of Somewhat Evil, forcing Somalia to join with Uganda and Myanmar in the Axis of Occasionally Evil, while Bulgaria, Indonesia, and Russia established the Axis of Not So Much Evil Really As Just Generally Disagreeable. With the criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up, Sierra Leone, El Salvador, and Rwanda applied to be called the Axis of Countries That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the Olympics; Canada, Mexico, and Australia formed the Axis of Nations That Are Actually Quite Nice But Secretly Have Nasty Thoughts About America, while Spain, Scotland, and New Zealand established the Axis of Countries That Be Allowed to Ask Sheep to Wear Lipstick. That's not a threat, really, just something we like to do, said Scottish Executive First Minister Jack McConnell. While wondering if the other nations of the world weren't perhaps making fun of him, a cautious Bush granted approval for most axes, although he rejected the establishment of the Axis of Countries Whose Names End in Guay, accusing one of its members of filing a false application. Officials from Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chadguay denied the charges. Israel, meanwhile, insisted it didn't want to join any Axis, but privately, world leaders said that's only because no one asked them.",
"Oh, No! he gasped as he surveyed the disaster before him. Never in his 40 years of life had he seen anything like it. How anyone could have survived he did not know.He could only hope that somewhere amid the overwhelming destruction he would find his 16-year-old son. Only the slim hope of finding Danny kept him from turning and fleeing the scene. He took a deep breath and proceeded. Walking was virtually impossible with so many things strewn across his path. He moved ahead slowly.Danny! Danny! he whispered to himself. He tripped and almost fell several times. He heard someone, or something, move. At least he thought he did. Perhaps, he was just hoping he did. He shook his head and felt his gut tighten. He couldn't understand how this could have happened. There was some light but not enough to see very much. Something cold and wet brushed against his hand. He jerked it away.In desperation, he took another step then cried out, Danny! From a nearby pile of unidentified material, he heard his son. Yes, Dad, he said, in a voice so weak it could hardly be heard.It's time to get up and get ready for school, the man sighed, and, for heaven's sake, clean up this room!",

Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said. I decided you were right. I had to change my name. I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation. Thank you for your advice. Sincerely, Dick van Dyke",

"Supplemental Rules for Bowling If you holler overs! before the ball passes the arrows, you get to throw the ball over, unless of course, you get a strike. In which case, you can renege on the overs. When your team is about 10 marks down in the 8th or 9th frame, you can invoke the rule First Team Through Bowling Wins the Game, and your team still has a chance. After a member of the opposing team bowls 4 strikes in a row, he/she must bowl the next 4 frames blindfolded. If he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames. When you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the Designated Bowler rule. After you have 4 splits in one game, you may say Kings X and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, Fair is Fair. If your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. Good bowling should be recognized. A ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike. It shall be the owners privilege to decide on the disposition of said dead ball - Burial at Sea, Dropped from an airplane over a live volcano, or a simple burial in the city dump.

Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books, and other holy objects to ward off the evil spirits.

"In most of the United States, there is a policy of checking on any stalled vehicle on the highway when the temperatures drop  to  single digits or below. About 3am one very cold morning, Trooper Allan Nixon 658 responded to a call there was a car off the shoulder of the road outside Shattuck. He located the car, stuck in deep snow, and with the engine still running. Pulling in behind the car with his emergency lights on, the Trooper walked to the driver's door to find an older man passed out behind the wheel with a nearly empty vodka bottle on the seat beside him.The driver came awake when the Trooper tapped on the window. Seeing the rotating lights in his rearview mirror, and the State Trooper standing next to his car, the man panicked. He jerked the gearshift into 'drive' and hit the gas. The car's speedometer was showing 20, 30, 40 and then 50 mph, but it was still stuck in the snow, wheels spinning. Trooper Nixon, having a sense of humor, began running in place next to the speeding  car.The driver was totally freaked, thinking the Trooper was actually keeping up with him. This goes on for about 30 seconds, then the Trooper yelled, Pull over! The man nodded, turned his wheel, and stopped the engine. Needless to say, the man from Dumas, Texas was arrested, and is probably still shaking his head over the State Trooper in Oklahoma who could run 50 miles per hour.Who says Troopers don't have a sense of humor?",
"I've been teaching now for about fifteen years. I have two kids myself, but the best birth story I know is the one I saw in my own second-grade classroom a few years back.When I was a kid, I loved show-and-tell, so I always have a few sessions with my students. It helps them get over shyness and usually, show-and-tell is pretty tame. Kids bring in pet turtles, model airplanes, pictures of fish they catch, stuff like that - and I never, ever place any boundaries or limitations on them. If they want to lug it in to school and talk about it, they're welcome.Well, one day this little girl, Erica, a very bright, very outgoing kid, takes her turn and waddles up to the front of the class with a pillow stuffed under her sweater.She holds up a snapshot of an infant. This is Luke, my baby brother, and I'm going to tell you about his birthday.First, Mom and Dad made him as a symbol of their love, and then Dad put a seed in my Mom's stomach, and Luke grew in there. He ate for nine months through an umbrella cord.She's standing there with her hands on the pillow, and I'm trying not to laugh and wishing I had my camcorder with me. The kids are watching her in amazement.Then, abou",
"During a high school break-in in Plymouth, North Carolina, two burglars found a camera in one of the classrooms and amused themselves by taking pictures of each other committing the crime. When they couldn't figure out how to get the film out of the camera, they concluded it wasn't loaded and left it behind. The men apparently didn't realize they'd been fooling around with a digital camera that stores pictures on a computer disk. Investigators downloaded the snapshots to a computer and got a complete photographic record of the break-in. The suspects were quickly arrested.A luckless thief pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery of a convenience store in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. The thief told a passer-by he was going to rob the store, gave the man a dollar, and asked him to go inside and buy a scarf to hide his identity during the crime. The bystander took the dollar, went inside the store... and called the police.",
"A Nevada fugitive wanted on fraud charges was arrested in Connecticut after he blew his cover by applying for a job... as a police officer. The Connecticut cops discovered the man's fugitive status during a standard background check. He had passed both the written and agility tests before being found out. Police called the man in to headquarters under the guise of getting his fingerprints, and served him with an arrest warrant instead.A repeat offender got a life sentence for a small-time shoplifting caper in Jupiter, Florida. The man stole $49.73 worth of boxer shorts, panties, a sports bra and some cigarette lighters from a Wal-Mart store. His mistake was flashing a knife at a security guard - which turned his petty theft into a felony. Since the man had been released from prison less than three years before, Florida's repeat offender law required the judge to send him away for life without the possibility of parole.",

The dog knocks the basket sharply into the butcher's shins.You dumb dog. As he reaches down to smack the dog, he notices a note and a ten dollar bill in the basket.The scribble on the note asks for three pounds of his best ground beef. The butcher figures this is too easy. He goes to the window and reaches for the dried up stuff that's been sitting out all day.The dog growls at him. The butcher turns around and, glaring at the pup, gets the best mince from the fridge. Weighing out about 2 1/2 pounds, he drops in on the scale with his thumb.Hmmmmm, a bit shy. Who'll know?Again, the dog growls menacingly. Alright, alright, as he throws on a generous half pound. He wraps it out, drops it in the basket, and drops in change from a five. The dog threatens to chew him off at the ankles. Another five goes in the basket.The butcher is quite impressed and decides to follow the piddy pup home.

The government takes both, hires you to take care of them, and sells you the milk.PURE COMMUNISM You have two cows. Your neighbors help you take care of them, and you all share the milk.RUSSIAN COMMUNISMYou have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.DICTATORSHIPYou have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.SINGAPORE DEMOCRACYYou have two cows.

Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACYYou have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.AMERICAN DEMOCRACYThe government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it.

The government doesn't do anything.BUREAUCRACYYou have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them. After that it takes both, shoots one, milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.ANARCHYYou have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price or your neighbors kill you and take the cows.CAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.HONG KONG CAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax deduction for keeping five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all seven cows' milk back to the listed company.

So you apply for financial aid from the European Union to subsidise your cows and are granted enough subsidies. You then sell your milk at the former elevated price to some government-owned distributor which then dumps your milk onto the market at east-European prices to make Europe competitive. You spend the money you got as a subsidy on two new cows and then go on a demonstration to Brussels complaining that the European farm-policy is going drive you out of your job.EASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACYYou have two cows. You sell the milk  at a high price to the neighbors or to anyone at the open-air market. If somebody asks for receipt, you charge for a two times higher price, so nobody will request an invoice. For concerned families with small babies you claim that the milk is bio, though you collect the grass for feeding at the side of the highway and you keep the milk in plastic barrels used previously as containers of dangerous chemicals. Later, your neighbor or anybody from town will steal the cows and will buy their meat for a high price, and if you ask for a receipt, you will be charged for a two times higher price.FINNISH SOCIALISMYou have two cows. Soon you have to kill one of them because in the Netherlands there is an overproduction of milk and the European Union rules say so.

The doctor realizes that this ulcer is a serious one, so you need an urgent treatment. Therefore, you soon get a call to the local hospital. The call's date is for 3 months later, because there is a queue with more urgent cases. Then your ulcer becomes even more serious because you remember that 40 percent of your income is taken for social tax.",

The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.So, he picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He again asked the students if the jar was full. They responded with a unanimous yes.The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and proceeded to pour their entire contents into the jar - effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.As the laughter subsided, the professor said, Now, I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff.If you put the sand into the jar first, he continued, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the faucet. Take care of the rocks first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.At that point, one of the students raised her hand and asked what the beer represented.Smiling, the professor replied, I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers.",

With all the tanks the Iraqis have, they go and before you notice it they have the wheeles, the tank is up on cinder blocks and they are out of there, just like they do in the city. We have tanks, with guns that turn 360 degrees. 360. So if you think about it, its like a drive by. So lets let all the blacks go in and control the tanks.

I can tell what's wrong just by looking - why can't you? he said smugly.The doctor nodded, stood back and looked the vet up and down.

Lights flashed, wheels buzzed and within seconds, a small card popped out. The card read, Fishing Off Florida.Ha! laughed the smartass. Actually, my father is dead! That was a trick question.The quick thinking salesman immediately replied that he was sorry the answer was unsatisfactory, but as the Ultimate Computer was precise, perhaps he might like to try rephrasing his question and try again.Ok, the smartass said, where is my mother's husband?Again there was a buzzing of wheels and flashing lights until a small card popped out.

"The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen.Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer.One student replied:    You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use.On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H  0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T  2 pi sqroot .Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper.'The student was Niels Bohr, the only person from Denmark to win the Nobel prize for Physics.",

I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the coins, the phone still ringing off the hook. As I stood up, I cracked my head on the open cash drawer.

We can offer to make him a cardinal, and then ask him to play Benjamin Netanyahu as your personal representative. In addition to showing our spirit of cooperation, we'll also win the match.Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made. Of course Nicklaus was honored, and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of the result.I have some good news and some bad news, Your Holiness, said the golfer.Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus, said the Pope.Well, Your Holiness, I don't like to brag, but even though I've played some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful and my putting was perfect.

"An old preacher was just getting out of church and was driving home through his neighborhood.  As he was turning the corner of one of the major streets in his neighborhood, he noticed 3 boys playing dice on the sidewalk, and betting money along with it.  The old preacher thinks to himself how awful the situation is, that these young children are already heading down the life of sin and he should do something to stop it.The old preacher pulls over and gets out on the opposite side of the street and starts walking over to the boys. He calls out to the oldest looking one and asked the boy to come here so that as he's walking towards the boys, the oldest boy would be walking towards him.  When the boy reached him, the old preacher asked him what he was doing.Gambling, sir retorted the boy.Gambling?! How old are you son? asked the preacher.I'm 14.14?! Well if you turn that around, you'll be 41.  You'll have reached the middle years of your life, and if you stick to gambling in all that time, you'll have thrown your whole life away.  You could have been married, had a successful job, kids, a home, a family, but no. You'll have thought gambling was such a good life.  Is that what you want?  Did you want to live your life through sin and banished from God's grace?N-n-o sir! wailed the boy.Good lad. Now head on home son. The lord is smiling to find out you've said no to sin the old preacher smiled as the boy went his way down the street.He looked back at the other 2 boys and realized they were still shooting dice. He calls back to the next oldest looking boy and asked him to come closer.You boy, how old are you son? questioned the preacher.I'm 12, sir. answered the boy.12?! Well now look here boy. If you turned that around, you'll be 21. You'll have been at the prime of your life.  You'll be halfway through college, seeing a very lovely young lady, talking about starting a family with you.  All these big decisions you'll be facing, and you'll have the heart to make them but not if you continue down this destructive gambling path.  The colleges will turn down your applications because your credit will be bad, and your young lovely lady friend will leave you because you just can't seem to get your finances in order due to this overwhelming problem of yours.  On top of everything the Mighty Lord will be frowning upon your conduct and your choice to live the life of sin. Leave this world behind son. It starts now. Now go on home son! Make the lord proud of you, for his warm smile will be all the coercing you need to leave this life behind.Y-y-yes sir! said the boy, and he went the opposite way down the street towards his home.The preacher thought his work was done for surely the final boy must have heard his words being said to his friend, but sure enough, when the preacher looked back, there he was, still shooting dice and gambling.I don't believe this! he muttered.  You boy, come here a second!The other boy walked casually toward the preacher.How old are you son? Let me show you why this gambling life is a bad choice for you.Good mister, cause I'm 11.

Times were changing, he was told, and the school demanded that faculty members hold a graduate degree. Merely having 20 years of distinguished experience was no longer considered sufficient qualification to teach. All new faculty were being required to hold a doctorate, it was explained, and the school was actually doing him a favor by letting him keep his job by getting only a master's degree.So John enrolled in a summer program at an out of state college. Three months of intensive seminars and then nine months of home study would get him his MA.On the first day of class, the instructor was taking roll. He stopped when he read John's name.

About a year later the baby has been grown.Mom collects the babies from the hospital where they are born somehow.Mom takes a pill every day and it's a baby pill. It makes a baby grow inside her tummy. When it's one year old it comes out of her and cries.Mom and Dad are happy together and then a baby comes along.The father gives the mother plenty of money. If he gives her enough, she goes out and gets a baby.To have a baby you go on a special diet and eat spinach and coal and stuff. Then you get real fat and that's the baby inside you. When you are so fat, the doctor cuts you open and gets the baby.",

We want the name 'Greenberg Brothers Air Conditioning' to be stamped right next to the Ford logo.Money is no problem, retorted Ford, but no way will I have a Jewish name next to my logo on my cars!They haggled back and forth for a while and finally they settled. One and one half million dollars, and the name Greenberg would be left off. However, the first names of the Greenberg brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every Ford air conditioning system.And that is why today, whenever you enter a Ford vehicle you will see those three names clearly defined on the air-conditioning control panel:HI  NORM  MAX",

"DARWIN AWARD RUNNERS-UP:1 - LOS ANGELES, CA. Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to remove a bees' nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a pineapple. A pineapple is an illegal firecracker which is the explosive equivalent of one half stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window some 10 feet away from the hive/shed. The concussion of the explosion shattered the window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani. Deciding Mr. Saduki needed stitches, the brothers headed out to go to a nearby hospital. While walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving bees. Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom, and died of suffocation en-route to the hospital.2 - Derrick L.

The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in public places. 3. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car parked at the front door. 4. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having coffee before reporting to duty.Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one else was hurt.AND THE 1998 DARWIN AWARD WINNER IS..... THOMPSON, MANITOBA, CANADA.Telephone relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications feed horn. Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shut-off switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told coworkers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip to forty below zero. Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic. Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded.and the add-on - perhaps a distant runner-upVermont native, Ronald Demuth, found himself in a difficult position yesterday. While touring the Eagle's Rock African Safari  with a group of thespians from St. Petersburg, Russia, Demuth went overboard to show them one of America's many marvels. He demonstrated the effectiveness of Crazy Glue ... the hard way. Apparently, Demuth wanted to demonstrate just how good the adhesive was, so he put about 3 ounces of the adhesive in the palms of his hands, and jokingly placed them on the buttocks of a passing rhino. The rhino, a resident of the zoo for the past thirteen years, was not initially startled as it has been part of the petting exhibit since its arrival as a baby. However, once it became aware of its being involuntarily stuck to Demuth, it began to panic and ran around the petting area wildly making Demuth an unintended passenger. Sally  hasn't been feeling well lately. She had been very constipated. We had just given her a laxative and some depressants to relax her bowels, when Demuth played his juvenile prank, said James Douglass, caretaker. During Sally's tirade two fences were destroyed, a shed wall was gored, and a number of small animals escaped. Also, during the stampede, three pygmy goats and one duck were stomped to death. As for Demuth, it took a team of medics and zoo caretakers over four hours to remove his hands from the rhino's buttocks. First, the animal had to be captured and calmed down. However, during this process the laxatives began to take hold and Demuth was repeatedly showered with over 30 gallons of liquid rhino offal. It was tricky. We had to calm her down, while at the same time shield our faces from being pelted with rhino dung. I guess you could say that Demuth was into it up to his neck. Once she was under control, we had three people with shovels working to keep an air passage open for Mr. Demuth. We were able to tranquilize her and apply a solvent to remove his hands from her rear, said Douglass. I don't think he'll be playing with Crazy Glue for a while. Meanwhile, the Russians, while obviously amused, also were impressed with the power of the adhesive. I'm going to buy some for my children, but of course they can't take it to the zoo, commented Vladimir Zolnikov, leader of the troupe.",

I'd say that you must be a bunny rabbit.Oh, thank you! Thank you, cried the bunny, in obvious excitement.  The bunny suggested to the snake, Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you've helped me.So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, Well, you're smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone and no balls.

At about 30 years old he finally goes to the doctor wanting to treat it.Can you treat this condition, doc? he whispers very silently, barely heard. Well, I can run a few tests and try to figure it out, the doctor says.About an hour later the doctor says to the patient, I have good news and bad news.What's the good news? the man whispers.The good news is that we can cure it.What's the bad news, doc?The bad news is that we'll have to amputate your penis, the doctor says.Oh no, I can't do that. Never mind, the man murmurs as he left the room.A few days later the same man was out swimming deep in the ocean when he saw a fin. He knew it was a great white shark. Then the shark started to swim closer and closer...Shark! Shark! he mumbled, but no one could hear him.Shark! Shark! he kept whispering - then he shouted, SHARK!",

"A Norwegian applied for a job as a logger deep in the Canadian woods.The foreman took him into the bush to test his knowledge of logging. He stopped the truck, pointed at a tree, and said, See that tree over there? Tell me its species and how many board feet of lumber are in it.The Norwegian immediately replied, Dat dere's a sitka spruce, eh? And she got 383 board feet of lumber in 'er. The foreman was impressed. He drove a little farther, pointed at another tree, and asked the same question.Lord tunderin'. Dat's yer Douglas fir. 690 board feet.They drove a little farther, and the foreman asked again.Yeller cedar. 242 board feet.The foreman was surprised; this Norwegian is correct and quick, not even using a calculator. He drove back to the office a little offended because the Norwegian is better at his game than he was. As they neared the office, the foreman figured out how to get the best of the new guy.He stopped the truck, handed the Norwegian a piece of chalk, and said, See that tree over there? Mark an X on the front of it. The foreman thought, How could he know which is the front of a tree?The Norwegian walked around the tree looking at the ground, then reached up, and marked an X on its trunk. Dat's da front a' dat tree, fer sure.The foreman laughed and asked sarcastically, Now what makes you think that's the front of that tree?The Norwegian looked down at his feet, rubbed the toe of one boot on the grass, and replied, Cuz somebody took a crap behind it, eh!He got the job and is now the foreman.",

"bLittle Birds/bDo you know someone who seems to know everything?When asked why, they say, A little birdie told me. Did you know they probably aren't lying? It is a little known fact that there are little birds that fly very fast, are never seen, and they are everywhere - thus, these creatures are called Flies Unseen Everywhere or FUE for short. These birds have an extensive communications network, and they can generally find out anything from anywhere quite quickly.Some of these birds befriend certain individuals and communicate with them by making clucking sounds, much like a chicken. They are not dumb like chickens, however, and can establish a sort of clucking language with the lucky person they befriend.This person is then the one who is always in the know; one step ahead of the competition - and those people who seem to be in the dark? Those who just don't get it? Those who's standard response to any given question is, Huh? Why, I think it now should be pretty obvious to all, that the reason is simply because they don't have a clucking FUE.",

Azninski, 30, had been drinking with friends when it was suggested they strip naked and play some men's games. Initially they hit each other over the head with frozen turnips, but then one man upped the ante by seizing a chainsaw and cutting off the end of his foot. Not to be outdone, Azninski grabbed the saw and, shouting Watch this then, he swung at his own head and chopped it off.It's funny, said one companion, when he was young he put on his sister's underwear.

"A prisoner in the new Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh attempted to evade his punishment by engineering an escape from his confinement. Jerome constructed a hundred-foot rope of bedsheets, broke through a supposedly shatter-proof cell window, began to climb to freedom down his makeshift ladder.It is not known whether his plan took into account the curiosity of drivers on the busy street and Liberty Bridge below. It certainly did not take into account the sharp edges of the glass, the worn nature of the bedsheet, nor the great distance to the pavement. The bottom of the knotted bedsheet was 86 feet short of the ground. But our hero did not reach the end of the rope. The window pane sliced through the weak cloth and dropped him to his untidy demise 150 feet below.But wait - there's more!Apparently, the prison rumor of the previous death did not reach a prisoner who was awaiting transfer to federal penitentary one year later. He tied eight bedsheets together and rappelled from his seventh-floor window, only to find the rope fell 25 feet short of the ground. Luckier than Jerome, he merely fractured his ankle and scraped his face.",

The interrupted prisoner, offended by the intrusion, attempted to start a riot, but was squelched by prison security.Prisoners in the Tapachula facility reported that Diaz was in the habit of prowling the prison roof during conjugal visits, in search of prisoners to supervise. Local law enforcement reported that the guard was clutching a pornographic magazine, which was retained as evidence, and binoculars, whose sentimental value led to them being given back to the family of the deceased.",

"Ivan, an experienced parachutist with 800 jumps under his belt, was videotaping a private lesson given by an instructor for a single trainee. He had attached the video camera to his helmet so that it would capture the entire day of instruction, and the supporting power supply and recorder were in a heavy satchel slung on his back.The group went up in the plane, and the instructor led the enthusiastic beginner through preparations for the jump. Ivan carefully documented the lesson, which needed to be perfect for the sake of posterity.When they reached the jump site, Ivan jumped from the back of the plane and filmed the student and instructor jumping from the front of the plane. A few heartbeats later, tape still running, Ivan realized that he had been so focused on filming the jump that he had forgotten to strap on his own parachute. An FAA spokesperson said that the video equipment strapped to his back may have been mistaken for a parachute.In the footage salvaged from the camera and spliced together, the student and instructor are shown in freefall befire they pull their ripcords and recede rapidly from view. Then the cameraman's hands reach for his own ripcord. When Ivan realizes he has no ripcord, ergo no chute, his hands are seen to flail about wildly, then the camera pans down towards the approaching earth...Film from the final stage of the plunge was destroyed on impact.",

Barcia had the foresight to anchor the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, and he even remembered to measure the length of the bungee cords to make sure that they were a few feet short of the 70 foot drop. He proceeded to fall headfirst from the trestle, and hit the pavement 70 feet below several seconds later.Fairfax County police said The stretched length of the cord that he had assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground.",

"Just after Creation the Lord noticed that the original male-female pair of snakes were not reproducing. He summoned them and said, I thought I told everyone to go forth and multiply? The snakes replied, Yes Lord, but we cannot. The Lord was annoyed and thundered, and why not? to which the snakes answered, You see, Lord, you made us Adders.We could have stopped here , but actually the Lord got real sore and threatened, I don't give a shit, just go forth and multiply!A week later when the Lord visited, Lo! - was he pleased. Adders here, adders there, adders everywhere. He called for the original pair. Congratulations, he said, and then not without some bafflement inquired, how did you do it? The ingenious pair replied, It was simple, Lord. We used logarithms.Alternative ending, Fibonacci coached us.",

"A young air force officer had a very beautiful wife. Early each morning he left his house and went to the airport, and an hour later his wife always left the house too, with a big white towel, and went for a walk on the beach.Her husband always flew over every morning, and when she saw his aeroplane, she held the white towel high above her head. When her husband saw it, he made either the left wing or the right wing of his aeroplane go down. The left wing meant, 'I will be busy tonight and won't be home,' the right wing meant, 'In eight hours I will be holding you in my arms.'One morning he flew over with eight other aeroplanes, and his left wing went down. Before his wife had time to feel sad about this, all the other aeroplanes flew over, and each one of them turned its right wing down.",

On hearing this, the Malay lady started to put on all her jewellery.An Indian woman sitting beside the Malay lady was curious and questioned her. The Malay lady said that the rescuers would save her because she would easily be identified by the glitter of her jewels.The Indian woman then started taking her clothes off. Both the Chinese and Malay ladies were shocked and questioned her. The Indian woman then replied that rescue teams do not usually look for survivors.They usually look for the Black Box first!",

"A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road.When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350. The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk that although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager.The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for the husband and wife to use. But we didn't use them, the man complains.Well, they are here, and you could have, explains the Manager. He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here, the Manager says.But we didn't go to any of those shows, complains the man again.Well, we have them, and you could have, the Manager replies.No matter what facility the Manager mentions, the man replies, But we didn't use it!The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager. The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check.But sir, he says, this check is only made out for $100.That's right, says the man. I charged you $250 for sleeping with my wife.But I didn't! exclaims the Manager.Well, the man replies, she was here, and you could have.",

Driving down his street, I slowed down to a near-crawl and hung my head out the window, looking for his house number. The house number proved to be irrelevant, though, when I looked up and saw him standing on his porch, waving at me! There I was with my head hanging out and my mouth wide open, looking like some kind of stalker! Needless to say, I did not wave back to him  and I never called him. What would I have said?!?",

"The May Day parade in Moscow is the largest, most important military parade of the year. For 1992's parade, Yeltsin and Gorbachev invited Bill Clinton to come watch it with them.The parade commenced with a battalion of tanks, followed by a division of infantry, followed by armored personnel carriers and mobile artillery. They had mobile ballistic missile launchers, electronic jamming vehicles, and throughout the entire time the formations were overflown by squadrons of the most advanced interceptors, fighters, and long-range tactical and strategic bombers. Clinton, who had never been this close to war in his life, was suitably impressed.Then he noticed that, way back at the end of the parade, there was a disorganized, messy bunch of men in rumpled suits tagging along behind the last artillery pieces.Who are they? he asked.Ah, said Yeltsin, those are our economists!But I thought this parade was military... said Clinton, confused.Mr. Clinton, said Gorbachev, have you SEEN the damage those men can do?",

"In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock. If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion. With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years, said Gates. The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates. You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution - even reduce your time in Purgatory - all without leaving your home.A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello - in character as Father Guido Sarducci - hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats, the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci, but critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures, said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. You take the parting of the Red Sea - we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage. The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger market. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were installed with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach the four corners of the earth, echoing MICROSOFT's vision of a computer on every desktop and in every home.Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired - One religion, a couple of different implementations, said Gates.The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.",
"There was a knock on the door. It was the man from Microsoft.Not you again, I said.Sorry, he said, a little sheepishly. I guess you know why I'm here.Indeed I did. Microsoft's $300 million campaign to promote the Windows 95 operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince every human being on the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some would say integral, part of living. Problem was, not everyone had bought it. Specifically, I hadn't bought it. I was the Last Human Being Without Windows 95. And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and he wouldn't take no for an answer.No, I said.You know I can't take that, he said, pulling out a copy of Windows 95 from a briefcase. Come on. Just one copy. That's all we ask.Not interested. I said. Look, isn't there someone else you can go bother for a while? There's got to be someone else on the planet who doesn't have a copy.Well, no, The Microsoft man said. You're the only one.You can't be serious. Not everyone on the planet has a computer, I said. Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC! Some people own Macintoshes, which run their own operating system. And some people who have PCs run OS/2, though I hear that's just a rumor. In short, there are some people who just have no use for Windows 95.The Microsoft man look perplexed. I'm missing your point, he said.Use! I screamed. Use! Use! Use! Why buy it, if you can't useit?Well, I don't know anything about this 'use' thing you're going on about, the Microsoft man said. All I know is that according to our records, everyone else on the planet has a copy.People without computers?Got 'em.Amazonian Indians?We had to get some malaria shots to go in, but yes.The Amish?Check.Oh, come on, I said. They don't even wear buttons. How did you get them to buy a computer operating system?We told them there were actually 95 very small windows in the box, the Microsoft man admitted. We sort of lied. Which means we are all going to Hell, every single employee of Microsoft. He was somber for a minute, but then perked right up. But that's not the point! he said. The point is, everyone has a copy. Except you.So what? I said. If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you expect me to do it, too?If we spent $300 million advertising it? Absolutely.No.Jeez, back to that again, the Microsoft man said. Hey. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a copy. For free. Just take it and install it on your computer. He waved the box in front of me.No, I said again. No offense, pal. But I don't need it. And frankly, your whole advertising blitz has sort of offended me. I mean, it's a computer operating system! Great. Fine. Swell. Whatever. But you guys are advertising it like it creates world peace or something.It did.Pardon?World peace. It was part of the original design. Really. One button access. Click on it, bang, end to strife and hunger. Simple.So what happened?Well, you know, he said defensively, it took up a lot of space on the hard drive. We had to decide between it or the Microsoft Network. Anyway, we couldn't figure out how to make a profit off of world peace.Go away, I said.I can't, he said. I'll be killed if I fail.You have got to be kidding, I said.Look, the Microsoft man said. We sold this to the Amish. The Amish! Right now, they're opening the boxes and figuring out they've been had. We'll be pitchforked if we ever step into Western Pennsyvania again. But we did it. So to have you holding out, well, it's embarassing. It's embarassing to the company. It's embarassing to the product. It's embarassing to Bill.Bill Gates does not care about me, I said.He's watching right now, the Microsoft man said. Borrowed one of those military spy satellites just for the purpose. It's also got one of those high-powered lasers. You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of grey ash.He wouldn't do that, I said, He might hit that copy of Windows 95 by accident.Oh, Bill's gotten pretty good with that laser, the Microsoft man said, nervously.Okay. I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no choice. If you take this copy of Windows 95, we will reward you handsomely. In fact, we'll give you your own Caribbean island! How does Montserrat sound?Terrible. There's an active volcano there.It's only a small one, the Microsoft man said.Look, I said, even if you did convince me to take that copy of Windows 95, what would you do then? You'd have totally saturated the market. That would be it. No new worlds to conquer. What would you do then?The Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.'Windows 95....For Pets'?!?!?There's a lot of domestic animals out there, he said.I shut the door quickly. There was a surprised yelp, the sound of a laser, and then nothing.",

The user will then remain in a state of hibernation until about a week before the Windows 95 ship date.We expect that the users will need a few days to recuperate and acquaint themselves with the changes that will occur in society between the onset of cold sleep and the release of Windows 95, explained a Microsoft spokesman. These may include the OJ Simpson trial ending, another m omentous Congressional election, faster-than-light travel and possible leaps in human evolution.Because Microsoft expects a large response to this offer, a vast area will be needed for the s torage facility. We have chosen the state of Utah, stated Microsoft, because nobody lives there anyway.Spokespeople for Novell and WordPerfect were reached for comment on this remark, but their words were not suitable for publication.IBM Corporation, which has previously responded to Microsoft promotions with competing offers for their OS/2 Warp said they would not be matching Microsoft's Cool User program. Freeze people? What for? Warp has already been shipping for months, said a source who asked not to be identified.Some industry analysts have wasted no time hailing Microsoft's plan as a bold, innovative move. In columnist Michael S. Brown's opinion column M.S. Brown Knows which appears in PC Weak, Brown claims, IBM has missed the boat again with their failing OS/2 strategy. Users clearly want to be frozen in liquid nitrogen and sealed in coffin-like units for an indeterminate period of time.Michael S. Brown made national headlines three years ago when he claimed that if Windows NT didn't completely replace DOS in six months, he would chain himself to grating comedian Gilbert Godfried. Today he clarifies that; I didn't say which six months.The cryogenic facility in Utah is expected to be on line April 1, 1995, but users wishing to b eta test the system may do so for a reduced fee of US$3,000.",
"What really does happen to MS programmers once they die?Did you hear about the Microsoft Windows programmer who died? He found himself in front of a committee that decides whether you go to Heaven or Hell.The committee told the programmer he had some say in the matter and asked him if he wanted to see Heaven and Hell before stating his preference.Sure, he said, so an angel took him to a place with a sunny beach, volleyball, and rock and roll, where everyone was having a great time.Wow! he exclaimed. Heaven is great! Wrong, said the angel. That was Hell. Want to see Heaven? Sure! So the angel took him to another place. Here a bunch of people were sitting in a park playing bingo and feeding dead pigeons.This is Heaven? asked the Windows programmer.Yup, said the angel. Then I'll take Hell. Instantly he found himself plunged up to his neck in red-hot lava, with the hosts of the damned in torment around him. Where's the beach? The music? The volleyball? he screamed frantically to the angel.That was the demo, she replied as she vanished.",

"One Sunday morning an old cowboy entered a church just before services were to begin. Although the old man and his clothes were spotlessly clean, he wore jeans, a denim shirt and boots that were very worn and ragged. In his hand he carried a worn out old hat and an equally worn out Bible.The church he entered was in a very upscale and exclusive part of the city. It was the largest and most beautiful church the old cowboy had ever seen. The people of the congregation were all dressed with expensive clothes and accessories.As the cowboy took a seat, the others moved away from him. No one greeted, spoke to, or welcomed him. They were all appalled at his appearance and did not attempt to hide it.As the old cowboy was leaving the church, the preacher approached him and asked the cowboy to do him a favor.Before you come back in here again, have a talk with God, and ask him what he thinks would be appropriate attire for worship. The old cowboy assured the preacher he would.The next Sunday, he showed back up for the services wearing the same ragged jeans, shirt, boots, and hat. Once again he was completely shunned and ignored.The preacher again approached the man and said, I thought I asked you to speak to God before you came back to our church.I did, replied the old cowboy.If you spoke to God, what did he tell you the proper attire should be for worshiping in here? asked the preacher.Well, sir, God told me that He didn't have a clue what I should wear. He said He'd never been in this church.",

"A pilot's flying a small, single-engined charter plane with a couple of really important execs on board. He's coming into Seattle airport, only there is thick fog, less than 10ft of visibility, and his instruments are out. So he circles around looking for a landmark. After an hour or so, he's pretty low on fuel and the passengers are getting very nervous. At last, in a small opening in the fog, he sees a tall building with one guy working alone on the fifth floor.The pilot banks the plane around and winds down the window and shouts to the guy, Hi! Where am I?, to which the solitary office worker replies, You're in a plane. The pilot winds up the window, executes a 275 degree turn and proceeds to execute a perfect blind landing on the runway of the airport 5 miles away. Just as the plane stops, so does the engine as the fuel has run out.The passengers are amazed and one asks how he did it. Simple, replies the pilot. The answer he gave me was 100% correct, but absolutely useless; therefore, that must be Microsoft's Support Office and from there the airport is just 5 miles away on a course of 87 degrees! Any questions?",

"MORNING WOOD!Get ready... this is quite possibly one of the funniest true stories I've read in a long while! No matter how many times I read it, I still can't keep the tears away!I caution the weak of heart before reading today's joke - you know who you are - so you might as well hit the delete key now...:Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare us guys ever hit what we're aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around, just so I'll make sure I hit something.You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling ya, those little buggers can't be trusted.After being married 28 years, my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise, if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fallen right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm such a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding about it. It's the dreaded morning wood.Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend, you can't aim. Well, hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself, so that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less than perfect aim. Now sometimes, when you're newly married,  you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie - so us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife, I told her, Look, it won't bend. She said, so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with morning wood. Well, it's very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee. So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control. It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.",

"A man finds a wallet with $700 in it. A few days later, he reads a notice stating that a wealthy man has lost his wallet and is offering a $50 reward to anyone who returns it.

What are you doing? the rich man yells angrily.The Judge responds, You are, of course, an honest man, and if you say that your missing wallet had $750 in it, I'm sure it did - but if the man who found this wallet is a liar and a thief, he wouldn't have returned it at all, which means that this wallet must belong to somebody else. If that man steps forward, he'll get the money - otherwise, it stays with the man who found it.What about my money? the rich man asks.Well, we'll just have to wait until somebody finds your wallet with the $750 in it!",

I'll sell them to you for $35 and then, when he returns, you can sell them to him for $50.The villagers rounded up all the money they could and bought as many monkeys as possible. Soon they had monkeys everywhere...... but they never saw the man or his assistant again.And now you understand the workings of the stock market.",

"In the city of Gilacopa during the year of 1832 there was a great poet. He wrote some of the most beautiful poems the world had ever known. One day his assistant was in his office and he noticed a sheet of paper on his desk and he figured it must of been the poets newest work.The assistant could not understand the poem so he took it over to the neighbor whom was much wiser than he. The neighbor looked at the poem and declared, It is clearly a tribute to the troops in Iraq, but this could not be so since this was the 1830's and there was no war in Iraq yet, so they took the poem to the psychologist who was much wiser than they.The pychologist looked at this and said, This is obviously a poem about a woman whom he loves, but this could not be since there were only two females in this town one that was 75 and another that was only 4, so the assistant, the neighbor, and the psychologist took the poem to the painter whom was much wiser than they. The artist looked at the poem long and hard and finally stated, This is obviously related to the poet having financial issues, but this could not be since the poet was a very wealthy man.The town argued for 3 hours over the meaning of the poem when a hobo saw the ruckus. He asked what the problem was and the townspeople explained to him their confusion and showed him the paper. After only a few seconds the hobo said, This is a receipt for wine and a $5 lap dance at The Pimps Titty Bar.",

You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a rose.

"When I was a young minister, a funeral director asked me to hold a grave side service for a homeless man with no family or friends. The funeral was to be at a cemetery way out in the country. This was a new cemetery and this man was the first to be laid to rest there.I was not familiar with the area and became lost. Being a typical man, of course, I did not ask for directions. I finally found the cemetery about an hour late. The back hoe was there and the crew was eating their lunch. The hearse was nowhere to be seen.I apologized to the workers for being late. As I looked into the open grave, I saw the vault lid already in place. I told the workers I would not keep them long, but that this was the proper thing to do. The workers, still eating their lunch, gathered around the opening.I was young and enthusiastic and poured out my heart and soul as I preached. The workers joined in with, Praise the Lord, Amen, and Glory! I got so into the service that I preached and preached and preached, from Genesis to The Revelation.When the service was over, I said a prayer and walked to my car.

Nick ran into his room, took off his clothes, threw himself on his bed, started stroking himself, and moaning, Ohh, I need a bike! I need a bike!",

"Yesterday my mother asked me to buy some stamps. Stamps, are available in 3p, 9p, 11p, 17p and 21p denominations. For three types of stamp I was asked to buy eight of each. For the other two types of stamp, I was asked to buy nine of each. Unfortunately I forgot which I was supposed to buy eight of and which to buy nine of. Luckily my mother had given me the exact money required to buy the stamps, £5.00 and the shopkeeper was able to give me the correct stamps. Which stamps did I buy? Eight lots of 11p, 17p and 21p and nine lots of 3p and 9p. The shopkeeper rightly figured that I required eight lots of each of the stamps, which came to £4.88, he also knew I required two more stamps which added up to the difference. QED.",
"Polly Perkins was after a talking parrot, so she went to the local pet shop in the hope of securing such a find. She was in luck. The shop assistant assured her that the parrot would learn and repeat any word or phrase it heard. Polly was delighted. However, a week later, the parrot still hadn't spoken a word. Polly returned to the shop to complain, however, it appeared that the assistant was accurate in what he had said, and refused a refund. Why didn't the parrot talk?

"There was once a boy born named Jeff. When Jeff was born, he only had a father, since his mother had died giving birth, and as a result, he was also an only child. His father looked at his new son, proud over his new baby's good looks and wise looking appearance. The father had high hopes for his baby.Soon, Jeff was already 4, and was sent to the local preschool. There, although the teachers said that he was a little misbehaved, still socialized a lot and made many friends. As a result, Jeff made his father proud of his son. When summer came and preschool ended, the father asked his son what he wanted as a present for making him so proud. Jeff thought a second and replied, I want a yellow golf ball. So, without hesitation, the happy father bought his son a yellow golf ball.Time passed, and Jeff was already in elementary school. Kindergarten was the same as preschool, so was first grade and second grade, Jeff had a great time, making friends and etc. Then when 3rd grade came Jeff was soon encountered with many obstacles, such as the popularity food chain and academics. Although, conquering these problems, Jeff managed to overcome them and get great grades, straight A's in fact. His father was so proud, and on graduation day, he asked him, Jeff, what do you want for your graduation present? Jeff replied, I want a yellow golf ball. The father now got a little curious, wondering why Jeff wanted another yellow golf ball. But, he still bought him the yellow golf ball.The summer zipped right by, and Jeff found him into the world of middle school. 6th-8th grade was challenging and tough, and distracted by a small crush in 7th grade, Jeff got an A-, although he soon got over it and got straight A's again. By 8th grade, Jeff was Valedictorian of his grade. His father was very very proud of Jeff, and when graduation day came again, he proudly hugged his son and let everyone know it was his flesh and blood that was valedictorian of the entire grade. So, he asked his son what he wanted for his graduation present, as well as a gift fro making him so proud. Jeff, again, said, I want a yellow golf ball. With these words, the father got very curious, why over these years all his son wanted were yellow golf balls? He gave him other options, Gee son, you know...you really made your old man proud. I'll get you anything. Do you want a, uh...Xbox 360? An HDTV? Orrr... Jeff just calmly said, I want a yellow golf ball. Now, for the third time in his life, he bought Jeff a yellow golf ball.Now, Jeff is in High School, where real challenges came. Jeff went through things such as peer pressure, curiosity, even more academic stress, and once again, the popularity chain. Freshman year went bumpy, although Jeff still delivered his usual amount of straight A's. In Sophomore year he got a girlfriend and smoked his first cigarette, decreasing his perfect grades, piling up A-'s and even a B. Of course, she dumped him in junior year, which sent him into depression; getting B's and even a C. Then, when the SAT's came, Jeff got serious. He prepared for it and although it was difficult, he aced it. Although, when senior year came, Jeff had to decide to completely put himself together and he quit smoking and once again managed to get the straight A's. He was, once again, valedictorian. His father was now so proud of him. After graduation, he asked his son, Jeff, you have filled my life with such happiness, I want to pay you back. What do YOU want the most? Jeff thought a second, and said, I want a yellow golf ball. There was an awkward silence, and the father was dumbfounded, and said, You sure? You don't...want a car or anything...maybe a pony? I want a yellow golf ball. Well...okay then. So, almost against his will, he bought his son another yellow golf ball.Jeff got into Harvard University, and the circle once again repeated. He encountered same obstacles, which now he was prepared for and easily avoided/defeated. He got perfect scores and even a girlfriend, who dumped him shortly after. He still had many friends and got into graduate school, which he did not plan on going to since he decided he wanted to have a life. All the professors loved him, and every student looked up to him. He was the role model student of Harvard. Soon, the 4 years passed and graduation day came once again. His father had heard of him and his reputation he had made for himself at the school and for his future. He was so proud of him and thanked God for blessing him with such a talented boy as a child. Since Jeff was over 20 and officially a man now, at home after his graduation party his father popped a couple of beers and congratulated his son, and in all the happiness he asked, Son...I cannot even describe what you have done for me...what do you want for your present? I will get you it. Jeff smiled and said, I want a yellow golf ball Right there his father just stood there for 5 seconds completely dumbfounded and confused. Why were yellow golf balls such an interest to his son? They could literally afford anything now . He said, Are you absolutely sure? You don't want...a Ferrari, a house, a yacht? I want a yellow golf ball So, feeling helpless but still happy at his son's achievements, he bought Jeff a yellow golf ball.Jeff soon went to live away from his father and on his own, although he still loved him very much. He became CEO of both Microsoft and Macintosh, and he managed to combine the two companies, making him dirty stinking' rich. But, he was humble and lived in a quiet house in Kentucky. However, one day tragedy struck, Jeff was engaged in a car accident involving an Asian driving student. He was hospitalized and told his condition was fatal. His father was contacted immediately. He saw his magnificent son, now in a mangled state, and in all the sadness he asked Jeff, ignoring all financial factors, what he wanted. He would get him anything, anything in the entire world. Jeff laid there in the hospital bed, weak, although through some strength, he said, Dad...I want...a yellow golf ball The father just went, .............., and now furious over the curiosity, he asked his son hastily although gently, Why do you want a yellow golf ball? Really. All these years, why? I want a yellow golf ball. ...No, not unless you tell me Jeff now sighed and said, Well, father, I want a yellow golf ball because--Then he died.This joke is dedicated to the friend that told me it, David S.",

My name is Bobby. You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.Oh, this? replies Hannah, I made it myself out of raw materials I found on the island. The oars are made from pine tree branches, I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides came from a Eucalyptus tree. But where did you get the tools from? he asks.Oh, I made the tools myself, replies Hannah. I found an unusual strata of exposed alluvial rock which I heated in my kiln. It melted into a soft iron-like material which I used to make the tools which in turn I used to make the boat.Bobby is silent. He can't believe her skills. If it's OK with you, why don't I now row you to my place? she says. Bobby just nods his acceptance.It takes Hannah just ten minutes to row to her place. As they near the shore, Bobby is surprised to see a stone walkway leading up to a very smart sky blue bungalow. Hannah ties up her boat at a small jetty using a hand made flaxen rope, and they enter the bungalow.It's not really much, says Hannah, but to me, Bobby, it's home. Please sit down and I'll get you a drink. No thanks, Bobby replies, I just couldn't drink any more coconut juice.But you don't have to have coconut juice, says Hannah, How about a Pina Colada? I've made a still. As they sit down on her hand made couch drinking their Pina Coladas, Bobby looks around and is amazed at what Hannah has achieved in such a short time. After a while, Hannah gets up and says, I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. While you're waiting, why don't you take a shower and then have a shave? You'll find a razor in the bathroom cabinet.Bobby goes into the bathroom and runs his bath. It even has hot water from a kind of thermal heating device Hannah has rigged up. After his bath, he goes to the wooden cabinet and finds a razor made of shells roped together inside a swivel mechanism. While he's having an excellent shave, Bobby thinks, Hannah is unbelievable, truly amazing - whatever will I discover next? She can do anything. When he returns, Hannah greets him wearing only a few carefully placed vine leaves and smelling of honeysuckle - she looks utterly fantastic. Hanna beckons Bobby to sit next to her, which he does. Hannah smiles at Bobby in a seductive manner and slithers up closer to him.Bobby, she says, staring into his eyes, we've both been out here for 10 weeks. Now you've found me, is there something you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing to do for all these weeks. You know... Bobby can't believe it. You mean - I can check my e-mails from here?",

It was a new experience for me! But, when I got to Australia, I watched the carousel go around and I saw nothing but the long handle. I even checked the sticker, and it was from my bag. I was furious. I walked up to a woman who worked at the airport and said, Explain this to me! She looked at the handle.Are you sure that's your bag? she replied.Yes! I cried, but I'm missing most of it! Well, did you leave it unattended at some point? I guess I must've!Okay, now we've nicked it. Tell me what it looks like so we can get it back.

"Not sure if this is up yet but I haven't seen it so here it goes . . . A 30-year-old man suffers from massive MASSIVE headaches that dominate his life completely and cause him pain almost every single moment of every day. He's been going through this pain since he was around 20 and no doctor has ever been able to help him out in curing the pain though he has tried almost every pain killer, and several surgeries.  One day a doctor calls him in to talk. The man expects another prescription of pain meds and what-not so he goes in, but he's shocked to find that this doctor has actually figured out what's wrong.  You see, sir, says the doctor, You have a very very rare condition where your testicles press up against the base of your spine sending a searing pain directly to your brain.The man is shocked, so he asks the most obvious question though he's sure he knows the answer already. Doc, what are we going to do about it?The doctor replies solemnly that he will have to go under the knife and have his testicles removed. The man agrees, fearing living through the pain for the rest of his life.The operation goes perfectly and in six days the man is up and moving, completely pain free. The next day he decides to go out and buy a nice suit because he can know go out and enjoy himself.When he gets there, an elderly man is sitting at the counter, and upon seeing the man he stood up and shouted as loud as he could, I bet you need a size 36 sports jacket and a pair of trousers with 37 leg and 32 waist.The man was stunned, muttering, Well, that's exactly right; how on earth did you know?The elderly man replied laughing, Son, I've been in the business for 50 years, there ain't no one that can fool me.So the man tried on his clothes and they fit perfectly. The old man smiled again and said, What did I tell you, I've been in the business for 50 years!So the man stood in line to buy his new clothing when he realized he needed new underwear as well, so he turned to the old man and said, I bet you can't guess my size in underwear.The old man looked him up and down and the announced, You need a size 10The man then laughed and said, I got you! I've been wearing a size 8 since I was about 20!Now the old man was puzzled and said, Well sir, to be frank that's impossible. For a man of your size a size 8 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine, giving you one hell of a nasty headache.",

In me third year. They snapped me wang in half an' everything.A magic wang . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon, Harry Potter. It wasn't a question. You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wang. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wang for charm work. Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wang, eleven inches. Harry took the wang. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wang above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.Oh, move over, Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wang, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!'The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.Yes, Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding . . . Any second now, he might hear his mother again . . . but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to . . . or did he?Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wang, then, with a sigh, he raised his wang and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.Get - off - me! Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncles sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wang.",

"Dear John,I hope you can help me. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching TV. My car stalled and then it broke down about a mile down the road and I had to walk back to get my husband's help. When I got home, I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbour's daughter! I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbour's daughter is 19. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past six months. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I am a wreck and need advice urgently. Can you please help? Sincerely, Sheila John's reply... Dear Sheila, A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and check all rounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.I hope this helps, John",

I think deep down I just did not want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to finally check on her around midnight, I hid in the garage behind my golf clubs so I could get a good view of the whole street when she arrived home from a night out with the girls.When she got out of the car she was buttoning up her blouse, which was open, and she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on.It was at that moment, crouching behind my golf clubs, that I noticed a hairline crack where the grip meets the graphite shaft on my Taylor Made 460 driver.Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the PGA Superstore?Signed...Concerned Golfer",

"Take a look at these 45 items and see if you find yourself relating and laughing until it hurts!More often than not, when someone is telling me a story all I can think about is that I can't wait for them to finish so that I can tell my own story that's not only better, but also more directly involves me.Nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you realize you're wrong.Have you ever been walking down the street and realized that you're going in the complete opposite direction of where you are supposed to be going? But instead of just turning a 180 and walking back in the direction from which you came, you have to first do something like check your watch or phone or make a grand arm gesture and mutter to yourself to ensure that no one in the surrounding area thinks you're crazy by randomly switching directions on the sidewalk. That's enough, Nickelback.I totally take back all those times I didn't want to nap when I was younger.Is it just me, or are 80% of the people in the people you may know feature on Facebook people that I do know, but I deliberately choose not to be friends with?Do you remember when you were a kid, playing Nintendo and it wouldn't work?

There was no internet or message board or FAQ's. We just figured it out. Today's kids are soft.There is a great need for sarcasm font.Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f was going on when I first saw it.How the hell are you supposed to fold a fitted sheet?I would rather try to carry 10 plastic grocery bags in each hand than take 2 trips to bring my groceries in.I think part of a best friend's job should be to immediately clear your computer history if you die.The only time I look forward to a red light is when I trying to finish a text.Was learning cursive really necessary?LOL has gone from meaning, laugh out loud to I have nothing else to say.I have a hard time deciphering the fine line between boredom and hunger.Whenever someone says I'm not book smart, but I'm street smart, all I hear is I'm not real smart, but I'm imaginary smart.How many times is it appropriate to say What? before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said?I love the sense of camaraderie when an entire line of cars teams up to prevent a dick from cutting in at the front. Stay strong, brothers!Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said, Yes that's G as in......ummm...Goonies.While driving yesterday I saw a banana peel in the road and instinctively swerved to avoid it...thanks Mario Kart.MapQuest really needs to start their directions on 5.

Don't mind if I do!Why is it that during an ice-breaker, when the whole room has to go around and say their name and where they are from, I get so incredibly nervous? Like I know my name, I know where I'm from, this shouldn't be a problem.You never know when it will strike, but there comes a moment at work when you've made up your mind that you just aren't doing anything productive for the rest of the day. Can we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after DVDs? I don't want to have to restart my collection.There's no worse feeling than that millisecond you're sure you are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too far.I'm always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to my ten page research paper that I swear I did not make any changes to.Do not machine wash or tumble dry means I will never wash this ever.I hate when I just miss a call by the last ring , but when I immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail.

What a waste.When I meet a new person, I'm terrified of mentioning something they haven't already told me but that I have learned from some light internet stalking.I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes.Why is a school zone 20 mph? That seems like the optimal cruising speed for pedophiles...As a driver I hate pedestrians, and as a pedestrian I hate drivers, but no matter what the mode of transportation, I always hate cyclists.I keep some people's phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call.Even if I knew your social security number, I wouldn't know what do to with it.Even under ideal conditions people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket, hitting the G-spot, and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey  but I bet my ass everyone can find and push the Snooze button from 3 feet away, in about 1.7 seconds, eyes closed, first time every time...I think the freezer deserves a light as well.I disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with Miller Lites than Kay.The other night I ordered takeout, and when I looked in the bag, saw they had included four sets of plastic silverware. In other words, someone at the restaurant packed my order, took a second to think about it, and then estimated that there must be at least four people eating to require such a large amount of food. Too bad I was eating by myself. There's nothing like being made to feel like a fat %$! before dinner.",

"A Jewish anthropologist, Benny Steinfeld, was working in the desert near Israel when he happened upon an odd looking vase. After cleaning it he pried open the lid and was astonished when a genie sprang from the container and granted him 3 wishes. Steinfeld wished for enormous wealth, huge land holdings and a bevy of beautiful wives. All wishes were granted, but on one condition. Never again in his life could the anthropologist get a haircut or shave. To do so would mean instant imprisonment in the same urn in which the genie had been imprisoned. All went well during the first few years of his lavish lifestyle, but his beard and long hair became more and more of a problem. One day, during a moment of weakness and desperation he ran to the bathroom, grabbed some scissors and began cutting off his beard. Immediately his fortunes vanished, and he found himself trapped in the urn lying in the desert sand. The moral of this story? A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.",

This had gone on for years and the Drids were sick of it.One day a rabbi walked into the town and saw that all the people were unhappy. He went to a man and asked him what was wrong. The man replied, Our king takes all of our food and money and we hardly have anything. He lives wealthily while many of us starve.The rabbi pondered thus for a minute and said to the man, Gather up all your people. I have an idea. Later that night, all the people were gathered in the town square. The man said to them, You guys need to stand up for yourselves. Have any of you actually tried to talk with this king? The townspeople all murmured. Well, one of you should talk to him tomorrow and demand he stops. One man stood up and said he would do it.The next day the man and the rabbi went up to the king's castle which was up high on a hill. He said to the king, Please, oh great king, your people are starving and we have no money. Could you please spare us some of what we make? The king was infuriated; he kicked the man down the hill. The rabbi watched as the king did this. Later that night the rabbi had the same speech and said they need to bargain with the king. Another man volunteered.The next day the man and the rabbi walked up the hill to the king. The man said to the king, Oh great king, would you please let us have some of our money and food back? We will double our crop and still give you most but could you spare us some? The king was even more infuriated and kicked the man down the hill. The rabbi was astonished. He gathered the townspeople in the center and declared that he would go talk to the king.The next day the Rabbi walked up the hill by himself to the king. King! he roared. I have traveled far and wide and when I came to your town I saw that your people were unhappy. I have found out what you were doing to them. I am appalled! They are treated poorly and you must stop taking your people's food or they all will starve to death!The king pondered this for a moment and said to the rabbi, I have heard what you have to say and I will stop stealing from my townspeople. I have enough wealth already, I guess I could spare them.The rabbi had one more question for the king. Why do you kick your townpeople down the hill?The king laughed and replied, Silly rabbi; kicks are for Drids.",
